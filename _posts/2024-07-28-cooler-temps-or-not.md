Now that I've fixed the fuel leak, I'm taking another shot at the engine temps.

<!--more-->

After getting the fuel lines and banjo fittings replaced, I decided to work on the engine temps. When I'm out, it only takes about 5 minutes before the dash gauge is showing the needle on 'H'. Pointing my digital infrared gun at the thermostat housing after a 15-minute slow drive shows temps around 195F to 200F (91C-93C).

I read some posts on MGEXP and watched some of John Twist's videos on the subject. I see a lot of experienced owners don't fret about the gauge so long as the radiator isn't overflowing. In my case, it's not, but I'm a little wary of exerting a lot of stress on the engine. Especially when we have summers with 60 days of 100F (38C) and higher temperatures.

Previously, I've added an overflow reservoir on the radiator and put in a more efficient nylon 7-blade fan. These definitely helped. Last year, I put in a 185F (88C) thermostat, thinking that would help. I've recently been told this is not the correct choice for our conditions, so I've since replaced it with a 160F (71C) thermostat. I've also replaced the temperature sending unit in the thermostat housing.

A couple 30-minute drives in 95F (36C) weather is showing the gauge needle between N and H, so it's definitely an improvement.

Looking toward next summer and we're thinking of doing a couple of car shows. I'm going to start on improvements I can do to make driving and showing Pearline a better experience.

* I am going to modify the exhaust system to put a muffler back on. Straight pipes are just too much noise.
* Work on the driver and passenger doors so the windows slide up and down easier. Since painting, they catch on something.
* Get the doors better aligned. Angie has a hard time getting the passenger door to open. The shop where I had the paint done says they have a tool that will help reset the doors on the frame.
* Clean up the interior. Replace some of the switches
* I have the factory radio in the console hole, but it's not connected to anything. It was working 10 years ago, but haven't confirmed it now. I'm missing the mount plates for it, so I'll need to find or fabricate those. I originally thought to tie it into the sound system, but I think I'll just put a single mono speaker in the panel at the passenger footwell, like it was originally.
* Isolate the exhaust heat from the cabin. After 20 minutes, it gets uncomfortable to ride in the passenger seat.

Finally, I'm going to start on a book that I can put out at shows that has her history, the previous owners, and my restoration project, with links to this site.

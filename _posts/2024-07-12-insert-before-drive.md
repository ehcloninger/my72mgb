Pearline is running again and I have an unintended new piece of swag.

<!--more-->

I've messed around with the fuel pump several times the last few weeks. When I ordered the fuel line with the banjo connector, I didn't realize that I also needed a $0.39 washer. Not sure what happened to the original, but without it, I had a steady stream of fuel coming around the banjo fitting.

By the way, if you don't know what a banjo fitting is, see the photo below. I have no idea why they use these versus a regular post/clamp fitting, but there we go.

On a Saturday morning, I ran over to the local NAPA store with the banjo bolt in hand, thinking (incorrectly) that they would have one of everything I need. Turns out they didn't. The closest thing they had was a rubber washer that fit around the bolt, but fell apart when I started tightening the banjo bolt.

I didn't want to admit my stupidity to Jeff at LBCarCo, because every real mechanic knows you also order the washers/gaskets when you replace a part. I'm not a real mechanic, so I logged into my Moss Motors account, where I can be an idiot in anonymity. I ordered 2 of the banjo washers at $0.39 and a spare banjo bolt at $5.49, just in case. I went to check out and ran into the dreaded *Minimum Order monster*. I was $3 and change short of the $10 minimum. I flipped through the gifts section for something cheap and found a $4 item that brought the total to $10.27. I suspect Moss has such items strictly for people like me. With shipping, I paid $17.50 for (2) 39 cent washers. That's the life of an MG owner. No wonder we're all broke.

The package arrived about noon on Thursday. Once the sun had gone behind the house and the concrete cooled down below 100F (41C), I attached the new washer and bolt to the fuel pump. A quick test of the pressure showed I needed to tighten the bolt a bit more, as I was getting a drip every few seconds. Within 15 minutes, I had the rear tire put back on and Pearline was free of the jack-stands that are the bane of her existence. We celebrated by driving around town for a while and giving the grandsons a ride in Pops' car.

If the days will ever get back to where the highs are in the 80's (26C-30C), we'll put more hours on the motor.

So here I am, proud owner of a key fob emblazoned with Moss' logo and a clever saying. At least it doesn't say "Keep Calm".

When my [clutch gave out](/blog/after-the-prom/), the next Monday morning I was on the phone to the repair shop in OKC where I 
had left Pearline last fall. The owner told me he's backed up for weeks, probably a month or more.

One of the positive aspects of living where I do is I have access to a lot of people whose second job
is mechanic. Every farmer and rancher in this area can strip down a GM 454 (7.4l) engine because they
don't have time to wait for a mechanic when their crops are burning under the hot Oklahoma sun. We
also have a lot of general-purpose mechanics who set up shop wherever they can. These aren't shade-tree
mechanics, but they also aren't certified like your dealership mechanics are. They also don't bill 
at $160/hour.

I stopped by Tim's shop last week and asked if he could give Pearline a look. Tim has worked on the
car before, doing regular maintenance jobs. I described the problem and we looked over the repair manual
that every MGB owner keeps on hand. Tim felt he understood it enough to tell me which parts to buy, so
off to [MossMotors.com](https://MossMotors.com) I went. The parts arrived the following week and I took them out to the shop with
the car on a trailer.

After we had the car unloaded, he looked through the box of parts to make sure everything he needed was
there. It wasn't. One piece was missing. It's not a part of the problem, but he says any time you get
into the clutch, you should change that part. So, back to Moss Motors I went. I found the part. It was
$4. Because Moss has a $10 minimum, I had to put 3 in my shopping cart. Add in tax, and we're at $14. Then 
to expedite the process, I paid for premium shipping. 

I paid $50 to buy and ship 3 parts weighing less than 3 ounces. Nobody said restoring a 50-year old car was
cheap or easy.

**Update: 2021-05-21**: I talked with Tim and he had Pearline on the lift that afternoon. He was disconnecting
the clutch from the transmission as I called. It was about 3:00 PM on Friday, so I probably won't hear
anything back until middle or late next week. I'm itching to have her back, maybe by Memorial Day weekend.

I have tried to not make a pest of myself at the body shop, but I hadn't been by in a few weeks.
Bonnie, the office manager, greeted me warmly in the office and I told her I'd like to see my car. 
She told me to go on back and see for myself.

They'd finished the first primer coat this week and had just moved her to the storage room. The
owner was in the paint room with the door shut and the vents running, so I couldn't chat with him.
But, I'm happy with the results here.

They'll do another primer coat in a week or so after some sanding. Then, they'll apply the paint
and finally the clear coat. The owner told me at the start that he makes no guarantees about dates, 
but I'm hoping I might get her back by the end of the month or maybe mid-February.

Making some changes to social media accounts that I'm using.

Yes, it's an [ELO reference](https://youtu.be/wuJIqmha2Hk?si=-M_lEQFCzVxpiU_q).

While updating this site yesterday, I realized that I still have Twitter links in the side bar. I've
been using Bluesky for the last year and so I created an account for Pearline for our travels. I have 
an Instagram account for Pearline, but I don't post there, so I removed the link as well.

While looking about for other LBC owners on Bluesky, I didn't find a lot of activity. So, I created a
"starter pack" and added a few people I could find and have started conversations with them. I also
advertised the starter pack on a few other sites where drivers connect.

If you're on Bluesky, join us!

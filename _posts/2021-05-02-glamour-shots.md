Even though Pearline isn't able to move on her own, she can still pose for a few photos.

<!--more-->

I rolled Pearline out onto the driveway on a warm Sunday afternoon to take some better photos of her. My insurance
company wanted proof of the work I'd done to her, so I was documenting all the details.

I'm not quite ready to do a full portfolio of beauty shots, but I will, soon.

In the meantime, I took Pearline to an exhaust shop and had the worn-out muffler replaced with straight pipes.
She sounds wicked.

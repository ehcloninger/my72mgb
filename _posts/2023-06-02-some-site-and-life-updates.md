It's been a while, so I guess I'll get off my lazy butt and make some updates. If this post seems vaguely familiar, it's because it is.

<!--more-->

As I have mentioned on my [personal site](https://ericcloninger.com/blog/some-site-and-life-updates/), I needed to make some updates on the web hosting service I use for this site. I wanted to start using Google Analytics to measure traffic on the site, mostly out of curiosity, but also because my day job involves analytic data, so this is a funner experiment.

I haven't had Pearline out much in the past few months. Mostly because life is busy right now. I started a new job in April and I'm about to do quite a bit of travel. 

From a mechanical perspective, I've been smelling a bit of oil when I'm out. I had the oil changed less than 300 miles ago, so it should be alright. I haven't tried to get under the hood to figure out where the smell comes from. I will, just not now.

I might get to the July edition of Cars and Coffee in OKC. I intended to go this month, but we've had rains for almost a week straight with a better than 50% chance on Saturday, so I'll wait another month.

I'm having some issues with Pearline getting too warm on drives.

<!--more-->

First off, since the last update, we did a little something that took some time out of the middle of the summer. After we got home, we spent most of the time painting walls, putting down new flooring, and *trying* to merge two households of furniture.

This started about 2 months ago. It's been brutally hot all summer, with most days being about 100F (39C) degrees. I find if I take Pearline out in the middle of the day on one of these scorchers, I barely get 15 miles (22km) before the temperature gauge is in the "H" area. I didn't know if this was an issue with driving on hot days or if I had some other problem.

The experts on MGEXP say the gauges are notoriously unreliable, even when the cars were new, so I went to Harbor Freight and bought an infrared thermometer. After a 20 minute drive, the housing for the thermostat is 230F degrees while the engine block is around 280F. The radiator exterior shows 210F, while the radiator cap shows a "cool" 140F.

The concensus is that I have an air bubble in the coolant and I need to drain it and slowly refill. I had multiple people comment that they drive their cars in places like Phoenix and Los Angeles, so I just need to spend some time, effort, (and money) on the cooling system. I'm really not set up to do that here, so I have an appointment booked at a local NAPA-certified mechanic I know that also happens to like working on older cars. He's worked on Pearline a few times, including a [clutch repair](/blog/clutching-at-straws/).

While we're at it, I'm going to update the thermostat, put in a radiator shroud to help with the cooling, and replace the 6-blade metal fan with a 7-blade nylon fan. That's also supposed to help. I'm also planning to have him replace the fuel pump, since I bought it 9 months ago but haven't put it on myself.

On a related note, I've been buying parts lately from [LBCarCo](https://lbcarco.com) out of Michigan. The owners are really nice and they charge a fair rate for shipping. I still spend money with Moss when they are having a sale with free shipping, but if I need a couple of gaskets, it's much easier buying from LBCarCo because they usually ship in 1 day.

Maybe we'll get in another few weeks of nice weather to drive her after he's done. I've done a few trips this summer, none more than an hour away, so every bit of repair makes her even funner to drive.

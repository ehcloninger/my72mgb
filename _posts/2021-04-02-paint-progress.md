It seems so strange to have updates on two consecutive days, but it's been a whirlwind of activity after 4 1/2 months of slow (but steady) progress.

The car body, minus the hood and trunk were painted Wednesday evening (March 31). We stopped by the body shop after lunch today and the owner was in the paint room with the hood and trunk. He says he'll give them until the middle of next week to dry, and then they'll start reassembling everything. With luck, I might have Pearline back in my hands around the middle of April.

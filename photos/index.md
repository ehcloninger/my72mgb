Pearline didn't get a lot of attention in her first 48 years. She was a member of the family, but she wasn't the 
center of attention. That changed a bit in 2020, when I decided to start a restoration project on her. She'll get
more attention on these pages in the future.

Here's how she looked during her restoration project.

As we start going places this summer (2021), more photos will appear here. Follow Pearline on

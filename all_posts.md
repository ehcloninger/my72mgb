We've had the MGB since my son was 3 years old. It's always been our fun car.

For his Junior Prom, my son and 2 of his friends rented a limo for them and their dates. For his senior
Prom, he went solo and wanted to drive the MGB. So, we spent a couple days doing some cleanup on it.

<!--more-->

We used old-fashioned rubbing compound and fine steel wool to get rid of all the old oxidation. Then
we washed and waxed her. I masked off the tires and spray painted the rims white. It wasn't bad for a
weekend job.

I'll spare the details, but let's say that the MGB came home with a little less paint than it left with.
Subsequent photos show a bit of damage over the front passenger fender. I didn't get mad as accidents do
happen. It's part of the story of the car now.

It's 2020 and everything sucks. My daughter didn't get to attend her Junior Prom because of COVID. But,
that didn't stop us from getting some photos anyway. 

<!--more-->

This photo is the MGB after the photo shoot. About 2 miles (3 km) from home, the car started sputtering as
I downshifted coming to the 4-way stop south of our home town. The engine died and I was stuck there. It was
obvious to me that the carbs were flooded. Beau and her friend were in a second vehicle, so they drove on home,
while I waited an hour for the carbs to dry out. At least 3 people I knew pulled up and either laughed at my
misfortune or offered to help. When I got home that evening, I made a decision to start a project to fix up
the MGB again.

I dropped Pearline off at Glass Auto in OKC on in the middle of August. Two weeks later, I had a doctor
appointment nearby, so I stopped by to get Mike's estimate. I'm not going to lie, I was really apprehensive
walking in the door because I didn't know what I was going to hear.

<!--more-->

The first prognosis was there are a bunch of small things wrong--none of them fatal. She just needed parts and
time to fix the things that were wrong. He said it was apparent that a lot of different shade-tree mechanics
had their hands on her. He had the carbs tuned up and she turned right over. That was something that hadn't 
happened in years. 

The first batch of boxes from Moss Motors that have carpets, the new convertible top, trunk liners, and body trim. 
Oh, and a "free" Moss Motors catalog, which has a few gems.

Later that week, I stopped by the shop and dropped off the convertible top. There is an upholstery guy that
knows the trick to installing MGB tops that works out of the same garage. It only took him a few days to get
it installed on the frame and the frame on the car.

While I had the car at the mechanics, I took the rims to a powder-coating place in Oklahoma City called
ColorFast. They promised a 5 day turn-around and gave me a pretty good rate on the work. I went with the
anodyzed black color. I also bought new Cooper touring tires and had them put on the rims after the 
powder-coating was finished. I think they turned out pretty nice. 

I ordered a set of chrome steel tire rings to go on the rims when everything is complete.

    title: "Not perfect, but better than 49 years of grease and mud."
---

I got Pearline back from Mike at Glass Auto on a Saturday in early October. It was a cloudy, cool day, so 
not a great day for driving with the top down. My girlfriend dropped me off at the garage and then drove on 
to an appointment. I spent half and hour talking with the usual suspects that hang around the garage on a 
Saturday morning and drove home through a light mist.

<!--more-->

The next day was warm and bright. A perfect day to get started on Phase 2.

I started by taking the seats out, pulling out the carpet, and removing the center console. The carpets are
48 years old, so it's not to difficult to see the wear and effects that the sun had on the black interior.

I disconnected the battery and then took a power washer to the interior. I didn't pay  much regard to what 
was getting wet. I used Simple Green in the soap tank and gave everything a good dousing. I used my wet/dry
vac to remove the remaining water and let her dry in the warm autumn sunlight.

Then, the elbow grease. I used a wire wheel on my drill to take off all the surface rust that I could. I followed up with repeated rinsing from the power washer. After 4 hours, she was noticeably cleaner.

That photo with the little boy is my girlfriends' daughter and grandson. He's loves cars, trucks, and tractors.

A few days later, I lifted her up and cleaned the insides of the wheel wells. I pretty much followed the same process as the interior. Soap, Simple Green, wire wheel, more power washing. Then, I applied Rustoleum black primer paint. I hope whatever future owners care for her don't hate me for that.

I took Pearline to a couple of body shops in the area. A couple flat refused to even consider the job because
they only do insurance work. One of these people said my car isn't in her software, so she would have no idea
how to price it. I thought that was strange, but I didn't argue.

<!--more-->

One of the body shops, which I've used in the past, spent 30 minutes going over her in great detail. He got
on his knees and inspected every inch, top and bottom. Then he said "you're not going to like this". I told
him I wasn't looking to spend $10,000 on the body work, so he sent me a quote for $9,968. I took that as his
way of saying he didn't want the job. He replied they just finished a 1955 Chevrolet Belair and billed the
owner $35,000. 

Another body shop owner didn't get out of his chair to look at her and quoted me $3,500. I passed on him as
well.

After striking out 4 times, I stopped at my favorite liquor store to get some beer. The owner and I have
known each other for 20 years and we have some good talks. He walked around Pearline a few times and said
"You should go talk to Dusty" and he gave me the address. 

I got to Dusty's place and told him who referred me. He spent 15-20 minutes looking her over and quoted me 
$5,000 to remove the dents, fill in where needed, and to put on a clear coat. The drawback was that he had 
at least a month of work in the shop, so I'd have to wait. "That's fine", I told him, I'll use the time to
continue cleaning her up and work on the upholstery.

Now that I had the rust removed from the interior, I applied some white Rustoleum primer to the interior 
areas. I also used the wire wheel on the battery cover and painted it flat black. I put plastic liners
in the battery wells (she's a converted dual 6v system, so she used to have 2 batteries).

I ordered a replacement dash cap and installed it during this time as well.

The big job for about a week was disassembling both seats down to the bare metal. I spent hours on
Halloween afternoon grinding away rust and then putting a coat of Rustoleum on the frames. I painted the
passenger seat in black and the drivers seat in white, just so I won't mis-match the parts.

Somewhere in those dozen boxes with Moss Motors on the side will be the new foam and seat covers.

Now that I've [found a body shop](/blog/shopping-for-body-shops/), I worked to remove the 
parts that shouldn't be there. The excess trim pieces, the convertible top connectors, the chrome badges around the body.

<!--more-->

While messing with some of the interior, something fell out from behind the glove box. I asked around
in some auto forums, and it appears this was the original owner of the car from the dealership. These
plates were used in the service department with a machine similar to an old-fashioned credit card
device. The owners log book would be stamped to show when work was done.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![](/assets/images/2020-11-16/20201101_142729.jpg){:width="50%"} 
<br/>*Original owners' service plate*
{: refdef}


My sisters' father-in-law bought it around 1978. I thought the car was originally purchased in Florida, 
but apparently I was wrong. Telephone, TX, stamped on the plate, is about 2 hours drive northeast of Dallas. 
It appears to be a few houses, a post office, a couple churches, and not much else.

Here she is, the last afternoon together, as I've removed the last bits of trim. I realized the next day
that I should've removed the riveted parts as well. The body shop owner said he would do that. I felt sad. We 
never took our kids to day-care, but I can imagine that's the feeling I might've had, dropping them off that
first day.

I stopped in at the body shop after 2 weeks to see the progress.
They've removed the bumpers, the body fittings, pulled the dents, and filled most everything in. 

<!--more-->

We talked about paint a bit and then decided on a Mopar white
that can be seen on nearly every Dodge Ram pickup out there.
While I wanted a bit of sparkle, it will be much easier to touch
up this way if I need to.

I stopped in at the body shop today as I was nearby. I'm trying to not make a pest of myself,
but it's hard not knowing what's going on.

<!--more-->

It was lunch time, so only one of the guys was there. I asked if he minded me looking in on
Pearline. I took a few photos and you can see below. They've done more body work and it's smooth
everywhere. The drivers' door, which was such a mess, is completely smoothed out. There's a light 
film of dust on every surface.

I chatted with the body tech for a while. He says they're going to remove the windshield assembly
and then get ready to start painting. I asked him if he needed any tips to getting the windshield
removed. He replied that he's been looking at MG forums and watching YouTube videos and that he
thinks they know what to do. He said there seems to be a lot of people talking about old cars, but
fewer people that actually know what they're doing. I'd say that's a constant across all hobbies
and professions.

I have tried to not make a pest of myself at the body shop, but I hadn't been by in a few weeks.
Bonnie, the office manager, greeted me warmly in the office and I told her I'd like to see my car. 
She told me to go on back and see for myself.

<!--more-->

They'd finished the first primer coat this week and had just moved her to the storage room. The
owner was in the paint room with the door shut and the vents running, so I couldn't chat with him.
But, I'm happy with the results here.

They'll do another primer coat in a week or so after some sanding. Then, they'll apply the paint
and finally the clear coat. The owner told me at the start that he makes no guarantees about dates, 
but I'm hoping I might get her back by the end of the month or maybe mid-February.

It's been a long 6 weeks since the last post, so here's where we stand on the body
work and paint.

<!--more-->

We're exactly where we were 6 weeks ago. A couple of big things have happened in the
meantime. First, the entire shop came down with COVID in late January, so they shut
everything down for 2 weeks.

Then, in early February, our area was hit with a massive winter storm. I'm sure you
heard all about how Texas was inconvenienced. This area was in single digit temps 
(Fahrenheit) for 11 days but did you hear us complaining like the folks in Baja
Oklahoma? Nooooo. The body shop couldn't do much in those temps, so they stayed home.
The owner says he has a bit of a backlog now, but hopes to start painting my car in
early March.

On the plus side, I took my seats to the same upholsterer that did my convertible
top. I bought all new interior cushions and new fabric. He should have the seats ready 
by early next week.

Despite being a day of tomfoolery, I have some real news to share.

<!--more-->

Several things have happened since the last update.

1. I've had the seats re-upholstered. When I got the car 21 years ago this month, the family member that owned the car hadn't driven it for many years. But, he was a very large man and the seats had long since given up trying to provide support. So, in addition to the seat fabric, I purchased new interior foam as well as the supporting rubber baffle that provides some "spring" underneath. I got the seats back a few weeks ago and installed the driver seat back in the car, so that the body shop weren't moving it around without a seat.

2. The car has been taped and had the hood and trunk removed. These will get painted separately.

3. The car is in the paint stall as of yesterday (March 31) and getting the second primer coat. After drying a day or two, it will get the first paint coat. I'll save those results for the next post.

With a bit of luck, I might have the car back in 2 weeks. We'll have to rush to get her road-worthy by the time of my daughters' Senior Prom if she plans to drive the car.

It seems so strange to have updates on two consecutive days, but it's been a whirlwind of activity after 4 1/2 months of slow (but steady) progress.

<!--more-->

The car body, minus the hood and trunk were painted Wednesday evening (March 31). We stopped by the body shop after lunch today and the owner was in the paint room with the hood and trunk. He says he'll give them until the middle of next week to dry, and then they'll start reassembling everything. With luck, I might have Pearline back in my hands around the middle of April.

Stopped at the body shop this morning to see how Pearline is faring. Bonnie (the office manager) saw me pull up and she met me at the door. "Do you want to see your car?" she asked, with a big grin on her face...

<!--more-->

Bonnie and one of the body techs led me into the warehouse. The hood and trunk have been attached. The windscreen is back on. Most of the lights are reconnected. They were planning to work on the car more today. The only things that remained were the body moulding, some door hardware, and some of the clips for the convertible top. Hopefully by early next week, I'll have her back.

I got Pearline back from the body shop today. I have 2 days until my daughter is supposed to drive the
car to her Senior Prom. There's a lot of dust everywhere and a lot of parts that need to be put back on. 
I've got a lot of work to do. Here's Pearline before I get started on all the details.

Today's the big day--my daughter's Senior Prom. All the work of the last year comes down to today. No big deal, no pressure.

<!--more-->

Yesterday, I did a lot of [cleanup on the car](/blog/back-home-again/). I put on pieces of trim and other decorative stuff. 
I wiped down all the surfaces with Armor-All wipes. I washed Pearline to get the surface dust/dirt off everything. I sprayed
Macquire's tire cleaner on the tires and put on the wheel rims. I put on the badges and logos.

Today is to put in the carpet and seats. I started about 8 AM on a somewhat chilly and overcast morning. I laid out the lining
and the carpet so I knew what went where. Then, I started the assembly process. I dry-fit in all the carpets and found them to
be more-or-less what was wanted. Then, I took a can of [3M #90 spray adhesive](https://www.amazon.com/3M-Hi-Strength-Adhesive-INVERTED-aerosol/dp/B004M8SHWY/ref=sr_1_2) and started with the transmission tunnel. Once I had the
heat shielding in, I started on the carpet.

Before putting the carpets in permanently, I ran power lines for the amplifier and speaker cables, so when I finally go to
put in the sound system, that I'll already have the wires under the carpets.

About noon, I had the carpets in that would go under the seats. It's about this time that my friend Todd showed up. Todd is
a rancher and carries a lot of tools in his truck. He also has a good eye for mechanic stuff. Between the two of us (and a
couple cold beers), we managed to get the seats installed correctly through the carpets and into original bolt holes. I'm not
going to lie, without his assistance, my daughter would not have driven the car to prom. I do know that I never want to remove
the seat bolts again, but I'm sure I'll have to, some day.

We finished about 3 PM (3 hours prior to promenade). We drove the car around town for about 30 minutes and then I started on 
the most important step--teaching my daughter to drive a manual transmission. We went to a deserted street on the edge of town
and spent about 30 minutes going through the basics enough that she could go through the promenade line. She is a quick study
and had it down. She even managed to take off going from a stop sign on a hill.

We then took the requisite photos of her in her prom dress with the car. She posts stuff about herself on her social channels,
but I'm not going to here.

As you can see from the last photo of the gallery below, she drove the car the half mile to the drop-off point on her own.
I might've shed a couple of tears as she got out of the driver's seat and onto the red carpet.

This is where the story takes a sad turn.

<!--more-->

After the kids were done with the promenade, I drove Pearline away from the school with my girlfriend in the
front seat. We met the parents of another senior student at a restaurant about 20 miles away. We had a drink
and a charcuterie plate while we talked about our futures without kids in the house.

About 9:30, we left the restaurant, with our friends following behind. I got onto Interstate 40 and headed toward
home. I'd made it about 10 miles from home when I suddenly lost all acceleration. The RPMs were over 4,000, but 
the speed was down to 40 MPH. I pulled over to the shoulder with our friends right behind us in their Lexus. He
turned on his emergency lights while semi trucks drove past at 75 MPH.

With the car in gear and the clutch released, I couldn't move forward or backward. Clearly, this was a clutch or
transmission problem. But, we weren't going to solve it on the side of the interstate at 10 PM. So, I called a
tow truck driver that I knew and he rescued us in pretty short order.

I thought I was done with the mechanical stuff, but clearly, I'm not.

Even though Pearline isn't able to move on her own, she can still pose for a few photos.

<!--more-->

I rolled Pearline out onto the driveway on a warm Sunday afternoon to take some better photos of her. My insurance
company wanted proof of the work I'd done to her, so I was documenting all the details.

I'm not quite ready to do a full portfolio of beauty shots, but I will, soon.

In the meantime, I took Pearline to an exhaust shop and had the worn-out muffler replaced with straight pipes.
She sounds wicked.

This is a text-only post, which means nothing good is happening.

<!--more-->

When my [clutch gave out](/blog/after-the-prom/), the next Monday morning I was on the phone to the repair shop in OKC where I 
had left Pearline last fall. The owner told me he's backed up for weeks, probably a month or more.

One of the positive aspects of living where I do is I have access to a lot of people whose second job
is mechanic. Every farmer and rancher in this area can strip down a GM 454 (7.4l) engine because they
don't have time to wait for a mechanic when their crops are burning under the hot Oklahoma sun. We
also have a lot of general-purpose mechanics who set up shop wherever they can. These aren't shade-tree
mechanics, but they also aren't certified like your dealership mechanics are. They also don't bill 
at $160/hour.

I stopped by Tim's shop last week and asked if he could give Pearline a look. Tim has worked on the
car before, doing regular maintenance jobs. I described the problem and we looked over the repair manual
that every MGB owner keeps on hand. Tim felt he understood it enough to tell me which parts to buy, so
off to [MossMotors.com](https://MossMotors.com) I went. The parts arrived the following week and I took them out to the shop with
the car on a trailer.

After we had the car unloaded, he looked through the box of parts to make sure everything he needed was
there. It wasn't. One piece was missing. It's not a part of the problem, but he says any time you get
into the clutch, you should change that part. So, back to Moss Motors I went. I found the part. It was
$4. Because Moss has a $10 minimum, I had to put 3 in my shopping cart. Add in tax, and we're at $14. Then 
to expedite the process, I paid for premium shipping. 

I paid $50 to buy and ship 3 parts weighing less than 3 ounces. Nobody said restoring a 50-year old car was
cheap or easy.

---

**Update: 2021-05-21**: I talked with Tim and he had Pearline on the lift that afternoon. He was disconnecting
the clutch from the transmission as I called. It was about 3:00 PM on Friday, so I probably won't hear
anything back until middle or late next week. I'm itching to have her back, maybe by Memorial Day weekend.

**Update: 2021-05-26**: After spending a day chained to my desk, I decided to kick off early and go by Tim's
repair shop. They were shutting the bay doors as I pulled into the lot. Tim waved, with his signature straw
hat in hand. I met him outside and heard the blow-by-blow of how they worked on my car. 

Apparently, the MGB has so little wiggle room between the transmission and the motor that they had to remove the 
motor from the mounts to work on the clutch. Where he thought this was a "5-hour" job (according to the rate manual), 
it's now closer to 12. I'm fine paying him and his crew what their work is worth. He says I might have Pearline 
back as late as tomorrow night or maybe Friday.---

I've been working on a site for Pearline's adventures. I'm now ready to show it off. Warning, gory technical details ahead.

<!--more-->

[Bah! Screw all that, show me the pics!](https://photos.ericcloninger.com/My-1972-MGB)

When I started working on Pearline, I wanted to give her a separate site from my own personal blog. Not that I 
need that much separation between my personal life and this hobby, but I wanted to try out some new ideas with
a new website. This project gave me the opportunity.

My requirements for this site were to be easy to maintain without having to worry about hackers getting into my
site and making a mess of things. The easiest way to do this is with something called a "static site". This means
that there are no servers running software to operate the site itself. There are no databases, there are no 
'admin' users. In a way, it's back to the Internet of 1996, with much better graphics. From a technical standpoint,
it's way better than websites in 1996, because I can update it moderately easy.

Another big requirement is to be able to show off photos of my car while I rebuilt her. I also want to be able to
post photos of Pearline and I on our adventures. A lot of static sites have difficulty showing photos because that
task usually requires "back-end" servers to keep track of all the photos. The setup that I settled on handles 
photos very nicely if you have a certain form of OCD, which I happen to have. If I process my photos in a particular
way, they show up easily on these pages.

I have a social accounts on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/my1972mgb) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/my72mgb/) 
that I plan to use to build a small following of old friends and new friends that we meet on the road.

### The Really Gory Details

If you're really interested in how all this works, the underlying technologies that run this site are:

* The [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) publishing system, by GitHub
* Microsoft [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for editing everything that I write and keeping all the files in their proper places
* The git version control system and the [GitHub](https://github.com) public repository hub
* The *Windows Subsystem for Linux*, for testing on my PC prior to making it public
* The [Netlify](https://netlify.com) build and deploy system. 

I recently switched to using Netlify after an online conversation with another Jekyll user. I was previously 
using Amazon AWS to host the site and handle all the plumbing that securely deploys and delivers the site. As 
an experiment, I tried a small site on Netlify and had it running within 15 minutes. That was all I needed to
switch. It took me about 30 minutes to get Netlify configured with DNS and LetsEncrypt.

With AWS, there's so much configuring because it's a general-purpose architecture. Netlify is made for my specific 
use case and others very similar to it. All the ugly parts are hidden behind a bunch of sane defaults. Oh, and it's 
free for personal use. Not that my $4/month bills on Amazon bothered me, but having a better system that costs 
nothing is pretty amazing.---

On April 23, I ordered copies of the "official" documentation for Pearline. I got the shipping notice on May 14.
The certificates arrived today via international post from the UK.

<!--more-->

The [British Motor Industry Heritage Trust](https://www.britishmotormuseum.co.uk/archive/heritage-certificates) is a part of the [British Motor Museum](https://www.britishmotormuseum.co.uk/). The trust holds
record books of Britain's motor manufacturers. These record books allow owners and restorers the
ability to see how their cars originally were built. For those owners that want to restore a 
vehicle to "as near as possible" condition, these records are a must. For people like me, with a
beloved British car, the documentation is an interesting chapter in the life of our cars.

The Trust issues a "Certified Copy" of the factory record for a vehicle. I purchased one of these
as well as the "technical specification" for Pearline. You can see these below, minus the couple
of bits that might assist someone in relieving me of her comforting presence. The certificate is
a very heavy "resume paper" (80#) faux parchment while the technical specifications are on a heavy
grade (28#) printer paper. The signatures appear to be human-made although I have no idea if the 
signature represents someone affiliated with the museum or not.

I don't think there's anything on these documents that are surprising to see. The body and engine
numbers line up. It's good to know the firing order, although I'm pretty sure that's illustrated
in my Haynes Manual for the car.

{% include gallery caption="British Motor Industry Heritage Trust Certicates" %}

As for how she is now versus how she was then, these things have changed...

* She's still white, but the paint is Mopar (Chrysler) Bright White (Pw7)
* The interior is now Autumn Leaf instead of Navy and the carpets are tan instead of black
* The factory hardtop is now in a landfill after taking flight from the back of my pickup, sometime in the early aughts
* The cigar lighter is now a USB port. Gotta keep those devices charged.
* The whitewall tyres (sic) are now solid black Cooper 4-ply. I inquired in an online group if whitewalls made sense, and the consensus was that they did not unless going full factory original.

The rest is mostly stock or replaced with OEM parts. I am (as of today) having the clutch replaced. The
replacement is allegedly still from the Borg &amp; Beck factory. I had the front and rear brakes replaced
last fall at Glass Auto in OKC. She still has the original front glass.

I'll put these documents in a folder to go with us to car meets. Perhaps someday, we'll meet out there
on the open roads.---

With the MGB now ready for the road, I've been thinking a bit about the future.

<!--more-->

As much as I might want to think otherwise, my motorcycling days are coming to an end. Or
at least a relatively long suspension. I've hurt my back in a way that will eventually
require surgery. When I get a spasm in my back, it renders me immobile. I could hurt someone 
on 1,000 pounds (450kg) of steel going 75 MPH (120 KPH). It's better to be in the cockpit
of a car, where maintaining balance isn't as necessary as when on 2 wheels. 

So, I'm thinking about how to enjoy life with 4 wheels. I want to take Pearline to some car
shows over the next few years. Maybe go to one of the big national meets where British car 
owners congregate. It would be fun to have a matching trailer for light camping along the way.

We towed a fifth-wheel trailer for 15 years, but I sold all that in 2017. It was fun, 
but carrying half your household in a 15,000 pound rolling castle meant that I was always 
repairing something. I'd like to have something simpler and smaller, that isn't meant to 
spend a lifetime in, just a weekend.

That's where teardrop trailers come in. They've been around for decades, but they're becoming 
quite popular with the backcountry camping groups. The off-road models have 17" tires and a
high suspension for getting over rock fields. That's not what I'm looking for. I want something
that looks like it was designed in 1965 and would match the styling of my car.

Here's one from [OKSchooners](https://okschooners.com/models/cs-series/) in Tulsa. It's not quite 
retro styling, but it would look pretty sharp behind Pearline with her white paint and black rims.

![](/assets/images/2021-06-02/cs-white-blck-trim.png)

It might seem strange to be pulling a trailer with a 1,800cc 4-cylinder car, but the MGB is rated 
to tow up to 1,800 pounds, according the reference manuals that I've read and there are plenty of
people on the Internet with stories of towing sailboats and small campers. I might not be doing
75 MPH down the Interstate, but I won't be chugging along at 45, either. The teardrops that I've 
researched usually weigh around 1,000 pounds (more or less). That leaves a couple hundred pounds for 
food, clothing, and whatever equipment we want to carry.

I've looked at a couple dozen manufacturers of teardrops. The basic functions are all the same. 
Some have a better galley/kitchen area than others. Some spend a lot of work on the interiors. 
Some focus on all the things that can be attached to the trailer, like screen porches and bike
racks. The problem with nearly all the places that build these things is that their existing 
orders are 15 to 18 months into the future.

I've run across a man locally that builds off-road teardrops in his spare time. His off-road models 
look nice. He wants to start building teardrops for classic-car models. I may work with him to design 
and build something exclusively for Pearline.

### Cart Before Horse

But, I'm getting ahead of myself. How will I tow this marvel if I don't have a trailer hitch
on the MGB? There are no commercial hitches available these days. However, a machinist in New 
Orleans named Keith Vezina has created a hitch design that most any competent machine shop can
reproduce. I talked with him over email and he said many people in his 
[local LBC group](https://www.bmcno.org/) have put these on their cars with good results, even towing 
trailers larger than a teardrop.

I'm including the designs and some photos below from the New Orleans MGB group. These aren't
my work, but it's always good to pass on community knowledge so that it stays alive.

I made a couple of updates to the MGB today and then took her for a drive.

<!--more-->

It was a beautiful, warm afternoon and I needed to get away from my desk for an hour. So, I decided
to replace the horns on Pearline. Like many LBCs, her horns were somewhat weak and didn't get other
drivers' attention. I'd been reading about Hella brand horns for some time and ordered a set for
Pearline.

Hella Horns are made in Germany and have nothing to do with California surfer talk. There are 
several models available with different volumes. I went with the 
[SuperTone](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00R3O0Y0M/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title)
model for Pearline. It's a loud, piercing sound, as you can hear...

{% include embed-audio.html src="/assets/images/2021-06-03/20210603_182259.mp3" %}

I started the upgrade by removing the front grill so that I could get to the screws holding
the horns in. While I had the grill off, I decided to clean, tape off, and paint the grill. 

> **Side Note:** This is what my wife and I always referred to as *"Painting the Sistine Chapel"*. We'd start a project, and then realize that we needed to do more, *while we were at it* and the next thing you know, 12 years later, you've painted the Sistine Chapel.

Once I'd put a coat of Rustoleum on the grill, I sat it on some bricks to dry. Then, onto the
horns.

Getting the horns off required a Phillips screwdriver and a 7/16 socket up inside the fender.
Once the old horns were removed, I created a splitter harness, as explained by *Gary E* in
[this useful post on MGEXP.com](https://www.mgexp.com/forum/mgb-and-gt-forum.1/hella-horn-installation-help.4313226.4314360/). The passenger side had 2 purple wires that went
to one post, while the other post had a purple striped wire and a black wire. The driver side
would just hook up directly. There did not seem to be a "positive" and "negative" orientation,
although the replacement horn spades were labeled "1" and "2".

The Hella horns only have one bolt-hole on the support rod, so I bolted them down into the
existing holes and kept the extra bolts for that time in life when I'll need an extra galvanized
bolt with a matching nut. Don't laugh, that day will come.

The last upgrade was replacing the worn-out pulls inside the doors. Took about 10 minutes to put
these on after removing the old ones. 

> **Minor Rant:** I don't know why Moss Motors doesn't put the screws in the package with small parts like this. It's not going to break the bank if they put a couple of $0.02 screws with the right threads in the pack.

Afterward, Angie and I drove Pearline down Route 66 a ways, just to make sure the horns were
noticeable over the roar of the exhausts. They are, which is a minor miracle because the new
straight pipes are l-o-u-d. I'm thinking to clean her up this weekend and take a bunch of beauty 
shots for the [photo gallery](https://photos.ericcloninger.com/My-1972-MGB).

After doing yard work, I washed Pearline and then drove around my hometown to take some beauty shots at local historic sites.

<!--more-->

First stop was the City Park, which houses the swimming pool, rodeo arena, and the fairgrounds. 
Our town has the oldest fair in the state, with rides, games, food, a rodeo, and livestock judging. 
It's kind of a big thing for a small town and all the effort is done by locals--no carnival company
or outside vendors. Sadly, COVID put an end to more than 100 years of tradition last year, but this
year we'll have it running again.

### Rock Island Depot

On the fairgrounds sits the Rock Island depot building that once sat alongside SH-58 and the Rock
Island line at the edge of town. I remember playing on this building when the railroad still ran
daily. These days, it houses the Historical Society.

### Truss Bridge

Next, was the bridge that spans the small creek that runs through the fairgroundss, separating the
rodeo arena from the midway and livestock areas. Previously, an old wooden bridge spanned the
creek and it was always dangerous. The community built this bridge in the mid-2000's as a community 
pride activity, selling engraved bricks as a way to get the townspeople involved. The county moved 
an old iron truss bridge that wasn't being used any longer to the fairgrounds and the people of our
town did the rest.

### Lucille's Station

Finally, out to Lucille's Route 66 station, also known as [Provine Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provine_Service_Station). I have many childhood memories of this place, sometimes stopping for
a cold soda with my Dad after a day of work (he would get a 6-pack of Coors Banquet Beer). I would 
buy beer from Lucille, when turned 18, as the law allowed 18-year olds to buy beer in those days. 
Lucille's beer cooler was infamous for producing beer with just a slight amount of ice in the top of
the bottle when you opened it. If it was a hot day, she'd fish around in the coolers and find a good
one for you.

If you find yourself on Route 66 in western Oklahoma, you'll likely run across Lucille's Station.
Most every guidebook will take you there. Lucille passed away about 20 years ago and her 
[grave marker](https://goo.gl/maps/qTPMtPUfEV6mKxPW8) is in Hydro Masonic Cemetery, about 3 miles 
north of the intersection of SH-58 and Route 66. Her grave marker is obvious to anyone that sees it.

Back home to put Pearline back in her barn before thunderstorms moved in. It's great to have her
back and working well. I still have some smaller mechanical jobs to do on her, but I'm going to
enjoy driving her this summer.

I have more photos of Pearline and the restoration project at my [SmugMug gallery](https://photos.ericcloninger.com/My-1972-MGB).

Two weeks ago, Angie and I decided to get Sunday brunch at a 
[state park](https://www.travelok.com/state-parks/roman-nose-state-park) 
that's about an hours drive away. It was a humid and cloudy morning when we took off at 10 a.m.

<!--more-->

The MG ran fine on the way to Roman Nose. We had the top down and a coat of SPF 30 on ourselves as we went
in and out of cloud cover.

The lunch was good and we left to explore the park for a while before heading home. About 15 miles from the park, we could 
see rain ahead. We stopped and put up the convertible top. I hadn't really paid attention when I first had the new 
convertible top installed, but this new one has a zip-down window, where the OEM top had a solid piece of clear plastic. 
I zipped down the window and we drove in relative comfort through the rain back home. We experienced a few drips inside the
cabin, that will be fixed when I put the new liners along the windscreen this fall.

{% include gallery caption="Sunday Brunch and Fuel System Issues." %}

Fast forward to the following Thursday. It was a relatively nice day in Oklahoma for July. The high temps were in the
mid 80's (30C), so I pulled out of the garage to get lunch. She started up fine, after having sat for 3 days. I made it 
only a few blocks before she started sputtering. I pulled over to try to get her going again. She would start and idle very
roughly for about 15 seconds and then die. I read some ideas on my phone from the MG forums, and decided to replace the fuel
filter on the spot. While I had the filter off, I confirmed that the fuel pump was working. The new filter didn't help.

About that time, one of the local guys with a tow truck spotted me. We've known each other for years. He put a tow rope onto 
her and pulled us home. I tried to pay him and he declined.

In the past week, I've read a lot of opinions on the problem. I posted on MGExp forums and had lots of useful advice,
but nothing that will get me going again. I've watched at least 2 hours of YouTube videos on how to tear down and
tune SU carbs. That's out of my league, so if I start thinking about that, I'll have to call Mike at Glass Auto in OKC.

In talking with a friend, he said they have completely done away with points in their distributors and gone over to
electronic ignition. Even on 1960s John Deere tractors, there are kits to move away from points. I know a lot of people make 
this conversion with good results, while others disdain it as "not factory". I'm not obsessed with having nothing but factory
parts, and I've read going electronic will give a decent performance boost. So, I've [ordered a new performance distributor 
kit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08SVZ275H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) with cap, coil, and wires. 
It should be here next week.

Until then, I'm enjoying these final 98 degree days for this summer from the cab of my air-conditioned pickup.

---
**NOTE**: I didn't realize I was ordering an international package until I looked up the link for the part on Amazon and
noticed it was shipping DHL. That usually is a good sign something is up. DHL isn't exactly known for great service.
Moss Motors and the other US-based suppliers didn't have the kit I wanted, so I used Amazon, which I normally avoid for MGB parts.
We'll see if it gets here without a lot of undue delays.

Today is Pearline's birthday. Exactly 50 years ago today, she came rolling off the assembly line in [Abington, Oxfordshire, England](https://www.nationaltransporttrust.org.uk/heritage-sites/heritage-detail/mg-motor-works).

<!--more-->

{% include gallery caption="" %}

Pearline has her hood up today, but I patted her fender and said thanks for being with us. The mechanic that has worked 
on her the most had hand surgery last month and won't be able to finish tuning her until some time in December. So, she 
sits in the garage, hopefully content that she's not out on an icy road or dealing with people that drive on the wrong 
side of the road.---

Several months ago, I [wrote about some fuel system issues](https://my72mgb.com/blog/fuel-system-issues/)
after Angie and I went on a nice Sunday drive. It's taken 4 months, but here's an update.

<!--more-->

The long and short of this update is I had to wait for my MG expert to have some surgery and recover.

While Pearline was down and the mechanic was recovering, I decided to have the distributor rebuilt.
I sent it off to [Jeff at Advanced Distributors](http://advanceddistributors.com/wordpress1/) in Minnesota. 
Jeff is a bit of a legend in the performance car world as someone who knows every detail about a distributor 
and how to tune it for different conditions. From doorstep to doorstep, it took about a month. I put the 
distributor back in, but I didn't try to mess with the timing because I was pretty sure we'd be doing that later.

Last week, I checked in on the LBC mechanic and he said to drop Pearline off on Wednesday, and he'll have 
time to give her a look. As it happened, I had a doctor appointment in OKC that day, so the timing was 
perfect. After my doctor appointment, I stopped by his shop in North OKC. He was still a bit tender from 
the surgery, so I did what I could to make things easier by fetching tools and operating the starter.

The problem I had with the fuel system was the fuel pump. It is still the OEM model and had never 
been removed from the frame of the car. So, for 50 years, that pump has been exactly where it was.
Mike tapped on the pump a few times with a screwdriver handle and then had me turn over the engine.
A few more times, then a few more. Suddenly, we had good fuel. The problem was debris in the fuel
pump that needed to be dislodged. The tapping got it going into the fuel filter, which we then 
cleaned.

After that, he tweaked the timing and checked the firing order of the plug wires. Then, he cleaned and 
gapped the plugs. Finally, he cleaned the carbs and set the idle to 1500 RPM. When I left, she was
purring.

In and out in about 3 hours. Same day service can't be beat!

On Mike's advice, I've ordered a replacement OEM fuel pump, still made by SU. With the holidays, it will
probably be January until it gets here. She's running just fine for now and I'm not planning to stress
her out, much.

I've spent the last 36 hours driving Pearline wherever I can. I've easily put 100 miles on her within
15 minutes of home, just to make sure she's working correctly. I think we're good until the next 
problem.

So, she's home for the holidays and I couldn't be happier.

Peace to you all.

We've had a bit of nice weather this week. Between bad weather and the general stress of dealing
with COVID protocols, I felt the need to get out of the house. I've managed to coax Pearline out 
for a drive a couple times.

<!--more-->

There's not a lot to report. She starts rough and needs a lot of choke. She doesn't want to take
off until she's had time to warm up. I have to keep reminding myself that she's only a few years
younger than I am and definitely more cranky. I give her a bit of revving until she's ready to
idle at a normal rate.

With the straight pipes, she will wake the dead. I suppose my neighbors would be annoyed, but then
I remember all the years of the neighbor kid idling his turbo Dodge diesel truck in his parents'
driveway. Then, I don't feel so bad.

Out on the road, both times this week, after about 10 miles on I-40 driving the legal speed limit
at 3,500 RPM, I pulled to a stop to have her idling at almost 3,000 RPM. I popped the hood/bonnet 
and found that the idler screw has worked itself to a position where she idles wide open. A quick 
turn with a screwdriver gets her back down to normal RPMs, but I may need to get a nylon nut on 
that screw or a bit of Loc-Tite.

Either way, a bad day driving an LBC is better than the best day working. Unless you need a tow truck.

Sometimes, in fixing a problem, you make it worse.

<!--more-->

As I mentioned in [my earlier post](/blog/wintertime-blues/), the idler screw kept working itself from
where I set it (about 900 RPM) to nearly wide open at 2,800 RPM. That's not good on the motor, not to
mention my nerves. I'd take her out for a short while and she'd find herself idling too fast.

After consulting with "experts", I decided to put a dab of Loctite on the threads. In their expert
opinions, "That oughta hold it". I got back from NAPA with the product in hand. I popped up the 
hood/bonnet and fired up the engine. With screwdriver in hand, I gave a light turn to the idler screw and...

IT POPPED OFF!!!

The head of the idler screw separated itself from the rest of the screw. There were curse words to follow.
Then, I shut the hood, shut off the engine, and considered for the 40th time why I have a Little British Car.
Then, I watched some pretty good playoff football games.

{% include gallery caption="Idler Screw" %}

Today, it was 65F degrees and sunny in the late afternoon. I fired her up and drove to my friend's shop, never 
idling less than 2,500 RPM. On the other hand, I had her up to a speed in excess of the posted limits, so there
is that.

I removed the air filters and got the nut and body of the screw off the carb mounts. 
Then, I drove home, again at 2,500 RPM. But, with the wind in my hair and the sun on my skin. I will try to see 
if there is a match at our local Ace hardware store. Otherwise, I'll order at $0.75 bolt and nut from Moss Motors 
and pay $12.00 in shipping.

Hey, I got 2 days of driving my MGB in January. That can't be all bad.

I've been wanting to go to the Oklahoma City Coffee and Cars meetup for almost a year.
Today, I had my chance.

<!--more-->

I had someone tell me about the OKC Coffee and Cars at Chisholm Creek (north OKC) about
a year ago. Every month, I thought about taking Pearline up there, but life always
managed to occupy my time. Today, I found the time with a little help from my daughter
and nudging from my fiancé (yes, you read it here first).

Last night, I printed up a sign with her details and this website (so welcome, new
visitors). I loaded my tablet with a bunch of the photos you see here, just in case.
I did some wiping of the interior with Armor-All cloths and made sure my interior was
spiffy.

Woke up at 5 and had a quick shower and a cup of coffee before the road (because old British
cars weren't equipped with cup holders). My daughter needed a lift to OKC to get her car,
so that provided the excuse.

I arrived at the site about 7:20AM and there were already at least 150 cars in the lot, 
even though the listed time was 8:00AM. You could tell some car clubs sent someone out 
early to stake their spaces, as there were a lot of road cones occupying slots. I found 
a space easily enough and spent about 15 minutes finishing my detailing with some SprayWay 
glass cleaner and Macguire's tire shine.

Within minutes, I had someone to talk with. He was retired and driving a C4 Corvette (1984 model)
but had to tell me about the MGA he drove when he was a teenager. That would prove to be the
pattern, over and over. Mostly men, but a few ladies too, all older than I, had stories about
how MG's were a part of their lives. One man returned several times to tell yet another story
about he and his brother in their MGs. Young people would stop by to check Pearline out as well,
even though the shiny Porsches, Corvettes, and McLaren nearby were much more to their tastes.

I walked around as well, looking at the variety. There were lots of Corvettes, which I have
great affection toward. There were plenty of late 60's/early 70's muscle cars, a fair number
of classic trucks and some "woody" station wagons as well. JDM cars cruised through in packs, as
did cafe racers.

The weather was perfect. It was slightly overcast for a while and then the sun slowly started
warming the place up. By 10:30AM, a lot of people were loading up, so I took that opportunity
to pack up myself.

It was definitely a good day, despite getting a bit red on the ride home with the top down.
Performance-wise, Pearline did fine. The stop-and-go traffic with stoplights had the temperature
needle in the danger zone a few times, so I found myself killing the engine at the lights and
restarting on green. Other than that, she did great and had more than a few waves. I 
hope to return or find another Coffee and Cars event in late summer or this fall.

I'm having some issues with Pearline getting too warm on drives.

<!--more-->

First off, since the last update, we did a little something that took some time out of the middle of the summer. After we got home, we spent most of the time painting walls, putting down new flooring, and *trying* to merge two households of furniture.

{% include gallery caption="June 2022" %}

This started about 2 months ago. It's been brutally hot all summer, with most days being about 100F (39C) degrees. I find if I take Pearline out in the middle of the day on one of these scorchers, I barely get 15 miles (22km) before the temperature gauge is in the "H" area. I didn't know if this was an issue with driving on hot days or if I had some other problem.

The experts on MGEXP say the gauges are notoriously unreliable, even when the cars were new, so I went to Harbor Freight and bought an infrared thermometer. After a 20 minute drive, the housing for the thermostat is 230F degrees while the engine block is around 280F. The radiator exterior shows 210F, while the radiator cap shows a "cool" 140F.

The concensus is that I have an air bubble in the coolant and I need to drain it and slowly refill. I had multiple people comment that they drive their cars in places like Phoenix and Los Angeles, so I just need to spend some time, effort, (and money) on the cooling system. I'm really not set up to do that here, so I have an appointment booked at a local NAPA-certified mechanic I know that also happens to like working on older cars. He's worked on Pearline a few times, including a [clutch repair](/blog/clutching-at-straws/).

While we're at it, I'm going to update the thermostat, put in a radiator shroud to help with the cooling, and replace the 6-blade metal fan with a 7-blade nylon fan. That's also supposed to help. I'm also planning to have him replace the fuel pump, since I bought it 9 months ago but haven't put it on myself.

On a related note, I've been buying parts lately from [LBCarCo](https://lbcarco.com) out of Michigan. The owners are really nice and they charge a fair rate for shipping. I still spend money with Moss when they are having a sale with free shipping, but if I need a couple of gaskets, it's much easier buying from LBCarCo because they usually ship in 1 day.

Maybe we'll get in another few weeks of nice weather to drive her after he's done. I've done a few trips this summer, none more than an hour away, so every bit of repair makes her even funner to drive.---

An update on my [previous post](/blog/overheating-issues/) about Pearline overheating.

<!--more-->

Short answer, too early to tell.

When I was driving Pearline this summer, we were in the midst of a 3-month high-pressure dome over Western Oklahoma. Temperatures were consistently in the high 90's (37C) and above. With the heat radiating from the asphalt, it was miserable to be out in a vehicle that's not air conditioned.

I consulted with the experts on the Reddit [r/littlebritishcars](https://www.reddit.com/r/littlebritishcars/) subreddit and came up with a plan of attack. With this latest bit of tinkering, Pearline now has 

* Upgraded fan from 6-blade metal (OEM) to 7-blade nylon
* Shroud around the radiator to focus the fan on the radiator
* 195 degree thermostat
* New water pump
* Radiator overflow tank
* Drained and put in new coolant

This all seemed to help. I did a 20 mile drive without stressing her too much. The dash gauge got to "N" (presumably "Normal") within 2 miles of the house and hovered just to the right of "N". But, the temperatures last week were in the 50s and 60s (10-18C). I will try to get in a few miles on the next warmish day we have to see if it worked.

While she was torn apart, we upgraded the fuel pump to a new model SU, which bolted in just fine. However, the screen on the fuel line was full of debris. Looking inside the tank, there was plenty of rust. That will be the next upgrade whenever Moss or LBCarCo has a sale.---

I started the first weekend of 2023 off with a drive, and a tow. Sigh.

<!--more-->

Since my [last post](/blog/update-on-overheating-issues/) about the overheating, I've made half a dozen short trips around town on small errands. She's been starting fine and running smoothly, albeit a bit herky-jerky until she warms up from the 50F (10C) temps.

---

Saturday turned out to be a beautiful day, with a temperature almost to 60F (16C). Clear skies and only a bit of wind. After some morning honey-do's, I decided to take the car about 40 miles to a motorcycle shop in El Reno to get a new battery for my 2-wheeler. This was to see how Pearline would perform, heat-wise, after a longer trip. The trip over, on I-40, was uneventful. In the parking lot, I did a quick check of the engine temps with a digital thermometer gun. She did great, and the needle never got above "N".

I bought my battery and talked with the parts guy for a while about our favorite bikes. He eyeballed Pearline for a minute as I pulled out. It was way past noon and I was craving a famous [Oklahoma onion burger](https://sidsdinerok.com/), so I decided to head into downtown.

I was about 1 mile (1.5km) from the motorcycle shop when I lost all my gauges and the motor stopped. I was doing about 35mph on a split 4-lane road. I was able to glide Pearline to a safe stop in a parking lot. I waited 20 seconds and cranked her back to life. I pulled out of the lot and kept going. I made it another mile before she died a second time with the same symptoms. Again, I was able to coast her to a safe place off the road with plenty of room.

This time, there was no restarting. The starter was strong, but no spark. Not even any smell of fuel.

I got out of the car to get my tool bag from the trunk/boot and remembered that I had done honey-do's in the morning. My tools were sitting on the garage floor. I didn't even have a rusty set of pliers on me, but I did have a pocket knife. I lifted the hood in disgust and tried to figure out if my knife could work loose the hose on the fuel filter. As I was bent over, a vehicle pulled up behind me.

Out came David, a tall lanky fella who appeared to be in his 70s with a long white beard. David had on a Harley t-shirt and a smile a mile wide. In his hand was a roll of tools. David looked under the hood and said "Ah, she's got the dual SU's. Best carbs out there--I've put them on a bunch of bikes."

In between ideas about what the problem might be, I got a bit of David's life history. To say it was colorful would be to leave out a lot of details. Regardless, he was the Good Samaritan I needed at that point, with some tools and enough knowledge to at least make a stab at it. 

We discovered the fuel pump was getting 12V, but not pushing fuel to the filter. That's pretty much meant that we weren't going to be able to make a roadside repair. Certainly not as the January afternoon was starting to cast long shadows. Even though it was moderately warm, I didn't want to be crawling on the pavement where I might get soaked in fuel.

I thanked David for his kind assistance and he departed. I called a guy I know with a tow truck and sat down to wait for his arrival. Ninety minutes later, as the remnant of the sun was disappearing over the horizon, we sat Pearline back down in my garage, my wallet $250 lighter for the effort. I drowned my sorrows with a cold Yuengling and decided to try again the next day.

---

Sunday, I went out to start tinkering and she started right up. Consensus from the experts on the MG forums is that I should've spent Saturday installing the gas tank that is sitting on the floor of my shop instead of a joy ride on a nice day. Some of the replies suggested the condenser in my distributor could've gone out, but that's unlikely since I had the distributor worked over in 2022 by the foremost authority on those. The distributor authority informed me the likely electrical culprit would be the coil, as a failed condenser won't give you a second chance like the one I got.

So, the next set of updates will be to put the tank and sending unit in and possibly a new coil.

> An amusing side-note. In looking for a specific model of coil for my MGB, I found the website of a former co-worker (or I believe to be him). He apparantly has a similar affliction, only with classic VW vans. Crazy, small world. Richard, if you're reading this, I enjoyed reading your site.---

Spent a nice Saturday afternoon replacing Pearline's fuel tank, with help from a friend.

<!--more-->

> This post will be a bit different. Less of a narrative of the experience and more of a "how to". There will be bits of my self here, but the hope is to pass along this knowledge to possibly the next newbie.

> Also, I recognize that I'm mixing tense and person in this post. It's stream-of-consciousness writing. It's not going into a peer-reviewed journal, so I'm confident the point will be made.

After my unplanned [tow trip](/blog/first-tow-trip-of-2023/), I [consulted with the experts on MGExp](https://www.mgexp.com/forum/mgb-and-gt-forum.1/first-tow-trip-of-2023.4604172/). The advice was split between the rust in the tank causing the engine to stop and taking the electrical with it versus the coil went bad from last summers' heat issues causing the fuel pump to stop working. I already had the replacement fuel tank in my garage and I ordered a Pertronix Flame Thrower coil after attempting (and failing) to find the gold standard Bosch Blue 00012 anywhere in North America.

During the week, I prepped by watching a few videos of people changing their MGB tanks. There are several on YouTube, but I like the one below from Steve Denton the best. He doesn't have a lot of useless narration about unrelated stuff, although you have to pay attention to what he's doing to catch the details.

[![Steve Denton's replacement video.](https://img.youtube.com/vi/6hpJj0vDACM/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/6hpJj0vDACM)

Since I'm not a diagnostic mechanic, but I can change parts, I set the following Saturday aside for working on the car. Temps were in the low 60's (16C) and a few wispy clouds. A good day to work out in the open. I was getting Pearline's tank drained when my friend Todd called. Todd is a rancher and he carries a mobile shop in the back of his pickup. In exchange for a promise of a grilled steak, he offered to help.

#### What You'll Need

I ordered the following parts from Jeff Zorn at [LBCarCo](https://lbcarco.com). Jeff usually is 10% cheaper than Moss Motors and he ships a few days quicker. His website is a bit old-fashioned, but you can search using Moss 6-digit part numbers.

    280-300 x 1 - STRIP, RUBBER, PACKING    MGT, MGA, MGB
    282-930 x 1 - SEAL TANK TO TRUNK
    293-410 x 1 - GASKET, FUEL SENDER
    323-628 x 1 - MOUNT KIT, GAS TANK
    328-280 x 1 - PLUG
    360-661 x 1 - SENDING UNIT,FUEL, SOLID STATE
    471-204 x 1 - FUEL TANK, REPLACEMENT

As you'll read below, there is one part I failed to order and should've.

    360-665 x 1 - SENDING UNIT LOCK RING

#### Before You Start

> Insert standard safety disclaimer here.

I started by chocking the front tires, in front and back of the tires.

I used my floor jack to raise the rear end and put the vehicle on jack stands under the rear axle, as close to the wheels as I could get. Then, I removed the floor jack.

#### Step by Step

1. I started off by draining the tank. It was about half full from the dash guage, so about 6 gallons (at $4.00/gallon). Some people use a siphon and I started off doing that as well. The siphon wasn't going fast enough for my liking, so I put an oil pan under the tank and cracked the drain plug at the bottom of the tank, which went faster. Once empty, I drained the oil pan into a pair of 5 gallon (20L) fuel cans for later disposal.

1. Remove the fuel supply hose from the gas cap at the back. This was a couple of spring clamps loosened with a flat screwdriver. Underneath the hose is a vent line that is held with a 9/16" nut. Remove these from the tank and move out of the way.

1. There were 2 wires on the sending unit on the right hand side of the tank (looking from behind). The green is positive. The replacement sending unit had 3 posts, but one was covered. I guessed that the covered post isn't used and that seems to be the correct guess, based on posts on MGExp. The ground goes in the middle and the green wire on the other uncovered post.

1. The fuel pump supply line on the right side used a 5/8" wrench/spanner to loosen. Once these connections were off, we started on the underside bolts.

1. The tank is held by nine bolts with a 9/16" nut. Four on the left, three on the right, and two along the rear. Four are accessed from under the tank and you'll need an extension to reach them. Todd had a cordless impact wrench, which made this process much simpler than using a hand wrench. Don't use a regular drill for this or you'll likely break your wrist. The underside bolts are the 2 on the back, the 1 middle on the left side, and the 1 middle on the right side.

    > **Wear safety goggles.** Trust me, there's lots of dirt under there. You don't want it in your eyes.

1. Get a 1 foot (30cm) square piece of plywood or a 3 foot (90cm) piece of 2" (5cm) lumber. Using your floor jack, snug the wood under the tank so it doesn't fall when you loosen the top bolts. Don't jack the wood up too far, just enough to hold the tank.

1. Loosen the top bolts and remove. The tank shouldn't fall because of the floor jack. You'll want to slowly bleed off the floor jack and probably need to wiggle the tank toward the left side to get it to come loose. Without fuel, the tank isn't so heavy--a single person can handle it.

    > At this point, I realized that I failed to order a part--the ring that holds the sending unit into the side of the tank (Moss no. 360-665). We scavenged the one off the old tank. This ring comes off with a flat blade screwdriver or a punch or chisel, gently tapped counter-clockwise with a hammer. Fortunately, it was intact and could be reused.
    
1. With the tank off, clean the area where it went. Take a wire brush or a drill with a wire head to remove the dirt and grease. Again, **wear safety goggles**. If your vehicle has an undercoating, like mine does, you probably won't need to do any more than this. If there's not a coating, use some rust-resistant paint, such as Rustoleum or *Chassis Black*.

    > The replacement tank I received had a few slight bends where the mounting holes were. We straightened these with a pair of pliers. Otherwise, the holes probably would not have lined up properly.

1. Before putting the tank into the car, assemble the sending unit on the new tank. The sending unit has a couple of non-symmetrical tabs that go into alignment holes on the tank, to ensure you are putting the unit in the correct orientation. Once the gasket and the sending unit are snapped into place, put the locking ring over the sending unit and gently tap it locked with a screwdriver and hammer.

    > Even though I'm saying *gently* tap the locking ring, you want to make sure it's snug and won't move further. I didn't get it completely locked into place and ended up with a small leak. The morning after my test drive, I went to the garage to find about 8 oz (250ml) of fuel in the pan I placed under the tank. After I tightened the lock ring a bit further, the drips stopped. The bad part is it's more effort to work on the sending unit with the tank mounted than when it's sitting on the work bench in the garage.

1. Cut the rubber strapping into 3 or 4 pieces to run the depth of the tank (front to back). The strapping didn't have adhesive, so I used some liquid silicone adhesive to hold the straps in place, so that they wouldn't fall off when mounting. This took about 10 minutes to cure.

1. Put some plumber's Teflon tape on the drain plug bolt and secure into the tank. The plug may not have a rubber seal. Mine did not, so I scavenged one from my tool chest.

    > We had an issue with the tank we received. The plug wouldn't go all the way in and we didn't want to torque it too hard for fear that the welded nut inside the tank would let loose and ruin the tank. We went to the local True Value hardware store and purchased a 1/2" *coarse* 13-thread/inch tap set. This tool, gently turned with an adjustable wrench into the drain plug hole, re-cut the threads that were fouled up when the manufacturer painted the tank. Once the threads were cut to fit the bolt, the bolt slotted in fine and we were able to fully plant it in the tank.

1. The replacement tank hardware kit should have 5 metal clips where you will tighten the top bolts into place. Place these over the holes for the top bolts. I suggest to use some masking tape to hold them in place, as these will move a bit when you install the tank and you don't want to go fishing for them from underneath the vehicle.

1. Time to put the tank in the vehicle. If you're on your own, you'll probably want to put it on the board and slowly jack the tank into place. Since Todd was helping, he got on the ground and gently lifted it by hand, while I hand-tightened a couple of the top bolts into place. The tank is bulky, but only weighs about 15 pounds (6kg). An able bodied person should be able to hold it. I used a Phillips screwdriver to center the metal clips for the bolts in the hole, then hand tightened.

1. With the top bolts in place, Todd attached the bottom bolts by hand. Then he reconnected the fuel hose to the pump. Next, attached the wires for the sending unit.

1. From the top, attach the vent hose to the tank. Then, attach the rubber filling hose and tighten the clamps into place.

1. Tighten the 9 bolts firmly, but not torqued into place.

1. The tank is baffled, so you'll need to use a bit of fuel to test for leaks. The drain plug is in the middle baffle. I put my oil pan under the drain plug and put about half a gallon (2L) in the tank. There was some slight dripping around the plug, so we removed it and used the heavier gas line tape (yellow roll) around the plug and made sure to tighten it a bit more. That appeared to have done the trick as I was able to get 2 gallons (8L) in the tank without a leak.

1. While Todd got back under the tank to finish tightening the bolts with his impact wrench, I popped the hood and removed the old coil. This is a 5 minute task involving removing 2 wires and 2 bolts. Since it's not germane to the tank replacement, I'm only mentioning it here to remember that I did this.

1. Clean up your work area. Seriously, your mother isn't here.

#### The Moment of Truth

It's a bit underwhelming to say it, but Pearline kicked right over. She sputtered a bit until the fuel from the new tank started feeding, but all appears to be well.

The next step will be to top her off with Premium at the local station and take her on an extended drive. If I end up getting towed home again, there will likely be another post tomorrow.

I took Pearline for a test drive this afternoon to see how she did.

<!--more-->

As I mentioned in my [earlier post today](/blog/replacing-an-mgb-fuel-tank/), we replaced the fuel tank and the coil the previous day. As I'd promised my friend and helper Todd a steak dinner in exchange for his expertise and tools, I didn't test the car yesterday. My goal in this test drive, aside from making sure Pearline works, is to not get so far away from town that the local tow truck driver has to drive 45 minutes to get me. 

I drove to the local gas station and put 10 gallons of 91 octane Premium in the tank ($4.09/gallon). From there, I headed to the next town, which is 7 miles away. Last summer, that short of a trip would already have the temperature guage on "High". Now, she barely touches "Normal".

Over the next hour and a half, I drove 75 miles (120 km) at speeds up to 80 MPH (130 km/h). She would hiccup a little on the upslope of a hill after decelerating from the downslope. Pretty standard behavior for an old carburated vehicle. I stopped 3 times and let her sit 15 minutes or so each time and she started back up strong each time. It's hard to say decisively that we solved the problem with the new tank, but it's certainly better than it was before.

When I returned to town, I pulled back into the same fuel station and topped her back up. I went 75.3 miles (120 km) using 3.3 gallons (12.5 L) of fuel. This came to 22.9 MPG (9.7 KPL) for the trip. Not great, but better than I was getting last summer, when I was getting closer to 15 MPG (6.3 KPL).

When I pulled in my garage, my friend Todd pulled in behind me, having seen me speeding through town. We had a beer and talked about (American) football for a while. I noticed a small puddle of fuel beneath Pearline as he was leaving. My guess is we didn't get the fuel pump line tight enough. Tomorrow is a work holiday, so I'll get her put up on jackstands and track that down. 

> 2023-01-16 - I got the MGB up on jackstands on Sunday morning. There was some drips on the floor of the garage. I drained the full fuel tank into 2 empty 5 gallon (20L) fuel cans, leaving perhaps 2 gallons (8L) in the tank. I tapped the lock ring off and compared the gasket from the sending unit with the one that I ordered separately. If only a bit, the separate gasket was a bit thicker. Or at least to my imagination. 

> I reassembled everything and made sure to tap the lock ring as tight as I could get from a prone position, on my back, under the tank. I refilled the tank from the fuel cans and then stopped at the filling station to top up any lost fuel. I went for a 75 mile (110 Km) drive, stopping a few times to let her sit and rest to see if any leaks happened. I had no issues.

> The next day, I could smell fuel in the garage, but there isn't any evidence of dripping. I am hoping it's just residual fuel smell from the previous day.

> It turns out the drip was because the sending unit lock ring wasn't tightened enough. I've since edited the previous post to indicate that the ring needs to be firmly tightened.---

Ran into some trouble trying to update Pearline's license plates this week.

<!--more-->

I went to pay for my Oklahoma tags today and the tag agent informed me that Pearline's title was cancelled. That was a bit of a surprise, to put it mildly. I've known the tag agent for 25 years and she was familiar with Pearline from the family member that originally owned her. She said she couldn't help, but gave me the number of the State vehicle records department.

I called the Oklahoma vehicles department and eventually was transferred to someone that looked up the title by the VIN. She said someone in the State of Illinois had transferred the title in May 2022 and then gave me the transferred title number.

From there, I looked up the number of the Illinois department that handles vehicles. Over the course of an hour, I spoke to Sarah, Geraldine, Ashley, someone that didn't give their name, and finally another Sarah. Second Sarah understood the problem and had the solution. At least, I hope it's the solution.

I will have to get an affidavit from our local PD, stating that the vehicle is indeed in Oklahoma and that the VIN/engine block numbers agree with the Oklahoma title that I have in hand. Sarah said this sometimes happens with older vehicles with 13-digit VINs, when the engine has been sold separate from the body. That isn't the case for Pearline, but alright. Sarah said their system pads out title numbers with 0's when they have a 13-digit VIN, which could be how it got duplicated.

Once I fax the affidavit and the original title to Illinois, they will release the title back to Oklahoma. Sarah said she will contact the person with the transferred title to confirm that the VIN for whatever vehicle they think they have.

Not sure if all this will happen by the end of the month when the plate stickers are due, but I can hold out hope that 2 state government entities will operate at some efficiency. Otherwise, there's a $100 fine for letting plate stickers expire. If it does work, I may need to buy a lottery ticket.---

A successful resolution to the troubles mentioned in the [previous post](/blog/title-troubles/).

<!--more-->

As I described in the previous post, I had to jump through some hoops to get the title transferred back to the State of Oklahoma.

I got the local PD Deputy to stop by and inspect the car. He viewed the title and I pointed out the VIN plates on the dash and the driver-side door well. While filling out the form, he told me about his own restoration projects on a 1981 Camaro and a 90's model Chevy pickup.

I faxed all this to Illinois on Thursday, February 9, about 10:00 AM. At 12:30, the person at the Illinois Secretary of State's office called to say she reviewed the docs and said she would release the title back to Oklahoma. She said to wait 72 hours and then I could go to the Oklahoma tag office to re-register the vehicle.

On Tuesday afternoon, I went to the local tag office to be told the title still was not valid. So, I made another call to Illinois to talk with Sarah. Sarah said she usually gets a confirmation email from the title database people, but hadn't, so she sent another.

I waited 48 hours and called my local tag office. Susan, who runs the office, said the title looked valid again. I went back that afternoon and was able to successfully register my vehicle. It's a good thing I tried to register the vehicle early in the month as waiting until the last week would've probably put me into March, requiring a $100 penalty.

Sunday is supposed to be 65F (18C) and sunny. I may have to go get lost on some lonely stretch of highway to celebrate.---

It's been a while, so I guess I'll get off my lazy butt and make some updates. If this post seems vaguely familiar, it's because it is.

<!--more-->

As I have mentioned on my [personal site](https://ericcloninger.com/blog/some-site-and-life-updates/), I needed to make some updates on the web hosting service I use for this site. I wanted to start using Google Analytics to measure traffic on the site, mostly out of curiosity, but also because my day job involves analytic data, so this is a funner experiment.

I haven't had Pearline out much in the past few months. Mostly because life is busy right now. I started a new job in April and I'm about to do quite a bit of travel. 

From a mechanical perspective, I've been smelling a bit of oil when I'm out. I had the oil changed less than 300 miles ago, so it should be alright. I haven't tried to get under the hood to figure out where the smell comes from. I will, just not now.

I might get to the July edition of Cars and Coffee in OKC. I intended to go this month, but we've had rains for almost a week straight with a better than 50% chance on Saturday, so I'll wait another month.

Welp, I buggered my site up a bit playing around. Also, some updates on the car.

<!--more-->

I managed to completely break my site and didn't realize it for 3 months. My [last update](/blog/goodbye-netlify/) was about me changing from using Netlify to AWS for my site hosting. That would've been a fairly straightforward change, only I was also playing around with some other stuff. I wanted to change the way images appeared on my site and had pushed some changes to the theme I used into a different code repository. But, it wasn't working properly and I forgot to roll back those changes. So, I had a bunch of screwed up images on my site for 3 months and didn't know it.

So, apologies for the screwed up images the last few months. Mea Culpa, Mea Culpa, Mea Maxima Culpa.

Anyway, onto the "fun" stuff.

### The Yard

The wife and I decided we wanted a new swimming pool. We've had those $800 jobs you get at Academy that last a couple years and then you throw them in the dumpster. We're getting to old to maintain cheap crap and decided to put some money into a proper pool and privacy fencing. Being a cheapskate, I decided I could still put up fencing and form concrete. *Long story short*, I still can, but just barely. The pool was installed by people who know what they're doing. The grandkids are enjoying it and we are too. Makes these 100+ degree (38C) days tolerable.

As part of this process, I moved Pearline out of her happy place in the shop to the house garage so I could put fencing, concrete forms, and various plumbing parts in the shop. Once all those other things were done, I went to move Pearline back to her spot. We made it there, but just barely. There was fuel on the floor of the garage and a trail of petrol all the way around the block. Oops.

When I went to fire Pearline up the next week, the fuel pump never could build up pressure and there was a puddle of fuel in the shop. Ahhhhfuckitallllll.

I decided I'd rather swim than crawl under a car for a few weeks. Last week was a car show at the next town over and I wanted to participate, but ... well ... swimming with the grandkids took priority. We did walk around the show and found 2 other local LBCs (Little British Cars). One was a V8 conversion that was really sharp.

I kinda regretted being a lazy-ass, but not much.

### Fuel Line

Feeling mildly chastised by myself, I woke up Sunday and crawled under Pearline in the early morning hours, before it hit 98F (40C). I discovered that the 53-years-young fuel line from the tank to the pump was cracked. They sure don't make rubber hoses like they used to. I had hoped to maybe trim off 3" (8cm) from the line and stick it back, but apparently the genius that worked on the fuel pump before me already did that.

So, with a cup of iced coffee in hand, I found the part number on Moss Motors. I popped over to [LBCarCo](https://lbcarco.com) and submitted my order. I order from Moss frequently enough, but their order process is a lot slower. Jeff@LBCarCo emailed me within an hour asking me if I'd prefer to save a couple dollars using USPS and wait a few more days or if I wanted the part as quick as possible. I chose the latter. Jeff is a gem.

The part arrived today. If Jeff has it in stock, I'll always use him and enjoy the 10% savings over Moss.

It's now 9:15 PM and I'm trying to decide if I'd rather smell like gas tonight before going to bed, or wake up at dawn and put it in before it gets too hot...

Well, that's a tale for the next post, I guess.---

Pearline is running again and I have an unintended new piece of swag.

<!--more-->

I've messed around with the fuel pump several times the last few weeks. When I ordered the fuel line with the banjo connector, I didn't realize that I also needed a $0.39 washer. Not sure what happened to the original, but without it, I had a steady stream of fuel coming around the banjo fitting.

By the way, if you don't know what a banjo fitting is, see the photo below. I have no idea why they use these versus a regular post/clamp fitting, but there we go.

On a Saturday morning, I ran over to the local NAPA store with the banjo bolt in hand, thinking (incorrectly) that they would have one of everything I need. Turns out they didn't. The closest thing they had was a rubber washer that fit around the bolt, but fell apart when I started tightening the banjo bolt.

I didn't want to admit my stupidity to Jeff at LBCarCo, because every real mechanic knows you also order the washers/gaskets when you replace a part. I'm not a real mechanic, so I logged into my Moss Motors account, where I can be an idiot in anonymity. I ordered 2 of the banjo washers at $0.39 and a spare banjo bolt at $5.49, just in case. I went to check out and ran into the dreaded *Minimum Order monster*. I was $3 and change short of the $10 minimum. I flipped through the gifts section for something cheap and found a $4 item that brought the total to $10.27. I suspect Moss has such items strictly for people like me. With shipping, I paid $17.50 for (2) 39 cent washers. That's the life of an MG owner. No wonder we're all broke.

The package arrived about noon on Thursday. Once the sun had gone behind the house and the concrete cooled down below 100F (41C), I attached the new washer and bolt to the fuel pump. A quick test of the pressure showed I needed to tighten the bolt a bit more, as I was getting a drip every few seconds. Within 15 minutes, I had the rear tire put back on and Pearline was free of the jack-stands that are the bane of her existence. We celebrated by driving around town for a while and giving the grandsons a ride in Pops' car.

If the days will ever get back to where the highs are in the 80's (26C-30C), we'll put more hours on the motor.

So here I am, proud owner of a key fob emblazoned with Moss' logo and a clever saying. At least it doesn't say "Keep Calm".

Now that I've fixed the fuel leak, I'm taking another shot at the engine temps.

<!--more-->

After getting the fuel lines and banjo fittings replaced, I decided to work on the engine temps. When I'm out, it only takes about 5 minutes before the dash gauge is showing the needle on 'H'. Pointing my digital infrared gun at the thermostat housing after a 15-minute slow drive shows temps around 195F to 200F (91C-93C).

I read some posts on MGEXP and watched some of John Twist's videos on the subject. I see a lot of experienced owners don't fret about the gauge so long as the radiator isn't overflowing. In my case, it's not, but I'm a little wary of exerting a lot of stress on the engine. Especially when we have summers with 60 days of 100F (38C) and higher temperatures.

Previously, I've added an overflow reservoir on the radiator and put in a more efficient nylon 7-blade fan. These definitely helped. Last year, I put in a 185F (88C) thermostat, thinking that would help. I've recently been told this is not the correct choice for our conditions, so I've since replaced it with a 160F (71C) thermostat. I've also replaced the temperature sending unit in the thermostat housing.

A couple 30-minute drives in 95F (36C) weather is showing the gauge needle between N and H, so it's definitely an improvement.

<p style="text-align: center;">&#x1F658;&nbsp;&#x1F65A;</p>

Looking toward next summer and we're thinking of doing a couple of car shows. I'm going to start on improvements I can do to make driving and showing Pearline a better experience.

* I am going to modify the exhaust system to put a muffler back on. Straight pipes are just too much noise.
* Work on the driver and passenger doors so the windows slide up and down easier. Since painting, they catch on something.
* Get the doors better aligned. Angie has a hard time getting the passenger door to open. The shop where I had the paint done says they have a tool that will help reset the doors on the frame.
* Clean up the interior. Replace some of the switches
* I have the factory radio in the console hole, but it's not connected to anything. It was working 10 years ago, but haven't confirmed it now. I'm missing the mount plates for it, so I'll need to find or fabricate those. I originally thought to tie it into the sound system, but I think I'll just put a single mono speaker in the panel at the passenger footwell, like it was originally.
* Isolate the exhaust heat from the cabin. After 20 minutes, it gets uncomfortable to ride in the passenger seat.

Finally, I'm going to start on a book that I can put out at shows that has her history, the previous owners, and my restoration project, with links to this site.---

We had a bit of a break in the hot August temps, so I took advantage of the opportunity to do some upgrades and take Pearline on a couple of rides.

<!--more-->

On one of my trips a few weeks ago, I lost my ball cap to the wind. I pulled over and walked back 200 yards (190m) to get it. I decided it was time to look into getting a rear wind blocker. This is a Plexiglass shield that forces wind to flow over the passenger area rather than just over the windshield. It bolts into the same holes that the convertible cover uses.

![](/assets/images/2024-08-10/458-294_1.jpg)

Both Moss and LBCarCo sell them, but Jeff@LBCarCo is almost always cheaper. In this case, about $80. 

The package arrived on an unusually cool August Friday afternoon. I finished work about 3PM and decided it was a perfect time to work on the car. It took about 15 minutes to get the convertible scissor-frame top off the car and another 15 to put the new wind blocker on.

In my [previous post](/blog/cooler-temps-or-not/), I mentioned getting the radio installed and working. I still have a plan to do that, but until I am ready to delve into that, I bought the blanking plate that goes where the radio normally would. While installing it, I had a flash of inspiration and tested the hole above the radio slot to see if my Bluetooth radio control would fit there. That hole was originally a map reading light, but it hadn't worked in the 25 years that I've had Pearline, so I removed it. I thought to eventually replace it with an LED, but I like the look of this.

![](/assets/images/2024-08-10/PXL_20240809_211051307.jpg)

After installing the upgrades, I drove to the local car wash and gave Pearline a low-pressure bath. Then some buffing with a chamois. Back home in the driveway, I gave the interior a good go-over with Armor-All wipes and plastic reconditioner. I applied some Maguires tire shine to all the wheels and then SprayWay glass cleaner on the chrome and glass parts.

At that point it was almost 5:00 PM and Angie was home from work. We took a nice ride to our favorite taco place about 15 minutes away. Going over, I took I-40 and the blocker definitely made an impact on the wind. Returning home, we took Route 66 at a slower, more comfortable pace.

Today, I drove Pearline to Walmart. Both trips this weekend have been about 30 minutes driving. The engine temps are holding nicely just above the "N" mark on the dash gauge.

I'm thinking that I might get to the [OKC coffee and cars](https://coffeeandcarsokc.com/) meeting in September.

Catching up on some of the fun parts of maintaining a British car!

<!--more-->

Our small town has their [annual fair](https://hydrofair.org/) this weekend and there's always a parade on Saturday. I'm getting Pearline cleaned up and shiny so we can participate.

I've had the tonneau top since I bought all the other parts in 2020, but I hadn't laid it out and fit it into the car. It's heavy canvas, so it should repel rain well enough. I'm more interested in it to keep the seats from getting too hot when we're at our favorite taco place.

The tonneau did not come with the snaps and buttons installed, because each car is different. So, I had to learn yet another skill--upholstery. I started with the couple of snap buttons on the sides and then moved on to the "Lift the Dot" studs that are at the front and go around the rear. The snap buttons were easy enough--punch a hole through the canvas for the stud on the female part of the button and put the cover over the stud. A couple of hits with the special tool crimps it together. I ordered extra buttons, but later realized that my car is missing 2 of the male pieces attached. I'll have to order those at some point and drill some holes in the doors.

For the "Lift the Dot" snaps, I used a leather punch to make 1/4" (6.5mm) holes for the stud that's mounted on the car. Then, I positioned the piece with metal teeth over the hole and used a slim metal punch to put 4 holes in the right places for the teeth to go through the heavy canvas. On the back side, a separate metal piece covers the teeth as they come out the other side. Finally, a bit of crimping to get the teeth bent over the backing plate. This took about 10 minutes per snap.

On a completely separate note, but relevant in some way. I was at my local True Value hardware this week and they had a close-out special on pressure washers. I picked up a Honda 3,400 PSI (235bar) pressure washer for a great price. No more feeding quarters into the machine in a bay where the previous user cleaned their horse trailer.---

The origin of one of the most notable songs about the joy of driving a car.

<!--more-->

<p style="text-align: center;">&#x1F658;&nbsp;&#x1F65A;</p>

If you're a fan of the band [Rush](https://www.rush.com/), you've probably heard "[Red Barchetta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LXKZq0fYDw)" many times, because it is a classic. Neil Peart (RIP) was their main lyricist and he loved to write songs based on what he was reading. I always assumed Red Barchetta was about an Italian sports car, based on the name, but I was wrong. It turns out, the inspiration came from an article from the November 1973 edition of [Road & Track](https://www.roadandtrack.com/) magazine.

There are scans of this article floating around the Internet and you can pull a PDF from dozens of places. I've reproduced the article here. Road & Track is the owner and Richard S. Foster was the author.

I'll add [my own thoughts](#my-thoughts) and an interesting postscript below.

<p style="text-align: center;">&#x1F658;&nbsp;&#x1F65A;</p>

**IT WAS A** fine morning in March 1982. The warm weather and clear sky gave promise of an early spring. Buzz had arisen early that morning, impatiently eaten breakfast and gone to the garage. Opening the door, he saw the sunshine bounce off the gleaming hood of his 15-year-old MG B roadster. After carefully checking the fluid levels, tire pressures and ignition wires, Buzz slid behind the wheel and cranked the engine, which immediately fired to life. He thought happily of the next few hours he would spend with the car, but his happiness was clouded—it was not as easy as it used to be.

A dozen years ago things had begun changing. First there were a few modest safety and emission improvements required on new cars; gradually these became more comprehensive. The governmental requirements reached an adequate level, but they didn't stop; they continued and became more and more stringent. Now there were very few of the older models left, through natural deterioration and . . . other reasons.

The MG was warmed up now and Buzz left the garage, hoping that this early in the morning there would be no trouble. He kept an eye on the instruments as he made his way down into the valley. The valley roads were no longer used very much; the small farms were all owned by doctors and the roads were somewhat narrow for the MSVs (Modern Safety Vehicles).

The safety crusade had been well done at first. The few harebrained schemes were quickly ruled out and a sense of rationality developed. But in the late Seventies, with no major wars, cancer cured and social welfare straightened out, the politicians needed a new cause and once again they turned toward the automobile. The regulations concerning safety became tougher. Cars became larger, heavier, less efficient. They consumed gasoline so voraciously that the United States had had to become a major ally with the Arabian countries. The new cars were hard to stop or maneuver quickly, but they would save your life (usually) in a 50-mph crash. With 200 million cars on the road, however, few people ever drove that fast anymore.

Buzz zipped quickly to the valley floor, dodging the frequent potholes which had developed from neglect of the seldom-used roads. The engine sounded spot-on and the entire car had a tight, good feeling about it. He negotiated several quick S-curves and reached 6000 in third gear before backing off for the next turn. He didn't worry about the police down here. No, not the cops ...

Despite the extent of the safety program, it was essentially a good idea. But unforeseen complications had arisen. People became accustomed to cars which went undamaged in 10-mph collisions. They gave even less thought than before to the possibility of being injured in a crash. As a result, they tended to worry less about clearances and rights-of-way, so that the accident rate went up a steady six percent every year. But the damages and injuries actually decreased, so the government was happy, the insurance industry was happy and most of the car owners were happy. Most of the car owners—the owners of the non-MSV cars were kept busy dodging the less careful MSV drivers, and the result of this mismatch left very few of the older cars in existence. If they weren't crushed between two 6000-pound sleds on the highway they were quietly priced into the junkyard by the insurance peddlers. And worst of all, they became targets ...

Buzz was well into his act now, speeding through the twisting valley roads with all the skill he could muster, to the extent that he had forgotten his earlier worries. Where the road was unbroken he would power around the turns in well controlled oversteer, and where the sections were potholed he saw them as devious chicanes to be mastered. He left the ground briefly going over one of the old wooden bridges and later ascertained that the MG would still hit 110 on the long stretch between the old Hanlin and Grove farms. He was just beginning to wind down when he saw it, there in his mirror, a late-model MSV with hand-painted designs covering most of its body (one of the few modifications allowed on post-1980 cars). Buzz hoped it was a tourist or a wayward driver who got lost looking for a gas station. But now the MSV driver had spotted the MG, and with a whoosh of a well muffled, well cleansed exhaust he started the chase ...

It hadn't taken long for the less responsible element among drivers to discover that their new MSVs could inflict great damage on an older car and go unscathed themselves. As a result some drivers would go looking for the older cars in secluded areas, bounce them off the road or into a bridge abutment, and then speed of undamaged, relieved of whatever frustrations cause this kind of behavior. Police seldom patrolled these out-of-the-way places, their attentions being required more urgently elsewhere, and so it became a great sport for some drivers.

Buzz wasn't too worried yet. This had happened a few times before, and unless the MSV driver was an exceptionally good one, the MG could be called upon to elude the other driver without too much difficulty. Yet something bothered him about this gaudy MSV in his mirror, but what was it? Planning carefully, Buzz let the other driver catch up to within a dozen yards or so, and then suddenly shot of down a road to the right. The MSV driver stood on his brakes, skidding 400 feet down the road, made a lumbering U-turn and set off once again after the roadster. The MG had gained a quarter mile in this manner and Buzz was thankful for the radial tires and front and rear anti-roll bars he had put on the car a few years back. He was flying along the twisting road—downshifting, cornering, accelerating and all the while planning his route ahead. He was confident that if he couldn't outrun the MSV then he could at least hold it of for another hour or more, at which time the MSV would be quite low on gas. But what was it that kept bothering him about the other car?

They reached a straight section of the road and Buzz opened it up all the way and held it. The MSV was quite a way back but not so far that Buzz couldn't distinguish the tall antenna standing up from the back bumper. Antenna! Not police, but perhaps a Citizen's Band radio in the MSV? He quaked slightly and hoped it was not. The straight stretch was coming to an end now and Buzz put of braking to the last fraction of a second and then sped through a 75-mph right-hander, gaining ten more yards on the MSV. But less than a quarter mile ahead another huge MSV was slowly pulling across the road and to a stop. It was a CB set. The other driver had a cohort in the chase. Now Buzz was in trouble. He stayed on the gas until within a few hundred feet when he banked hard and feinted passing to the left. The MSV crawled in that direction and Buzz slipped by on the right, bouncing heavily over a stone on the shoulder. The two MSVs set off in hot pursuit, almost colliding in the process. Buzz turned right at the first crossroad and then made a quick left, hoping to be out of sight of his pursuers, and in fact he traveled several minutes before spotting one of them on the main road parallel to his lane. At the same time the other appeared in the mirror from around the last corner. By now they were beginning to climb the hills on the far side of the valley and Buzz pressed on for all he was worth, praying that the straining engine would stand up. He lost track of one MSV when the main road turned away, but could see the other one behind him on occasion. Climbing the old Monument Road, Buzz hoped to have time to get over the top and down the old dirt road to the right, which would be too narrow for his pursuers. Climbing, straining, the water temperature rising, using the entire road, flailing the shift lever back and forth from 3rd to 4th, not touching the brakes but scrubbing of the necessary speed in the corners, reaching the peak of the mountain where the lane to the old fire tower went of to the left ... but coming up the other side of the hill was the second MSV he had lost track of! No time to get to his dirt road. He made a panicked turn left onto the fire tower road but spun on some loose gravel and struck a tree a glancing blow with his right fender. He came to a stop on the opposite side of the road, the engine stalled. Hurriedly he pushed the starter while the overheated engine slowly came back into life. He engaged 1st gear and sped off up the road, just as the first MSV turned the corner. Dazed though he was, Buzz had the advantage of a very narrow road lined on both sides with trees, and he made the most of it. The road twisted constantly and he stayed in 2nd with the engine between 5000 and 5500. The crash hadn't seemed to hurt anything and he was pulling away from the MSV. But to where? It hit him suddenly that the road dead-ended at the fire tower, no place to go but back ...

Still he pushed on and at the top of the hill drove quickly to the far end of the clearing, turned the MG around and waited. The first MSV came flying into the clearing and aimed itself at the sitting MG. Buzz grabbed reverse gear, backed up slightly to feint, stopped, and then backed up at full speed. The MSV, expecting the MG to change direction, veered the wrong way and slid to a stop up against a tree. Buzz was of again, down the fire tower road, and the undamaged MSV set off in pursuit. Buzz's predicament was unenviable. He was going full tilt down the twisting blacktop with a solid MSV coming up at him, and an equally solid MSV coming down after him. On he went, however, braking hard before each turn and then accelerating back up to 45 in between. Coming down to a particularly tight turn, he saw the MSV coming around it from the other direction and stood on the brakes. The sudden extreme pressure in the brake lines was too much for the rear brake line which had been twisted somewhat in his spin, and it broke, robbing Buzz of his brakes. In sheer desperation he pulled the handbrake as tightly as it would go and rammed the gear lever into 1st, popping the clutch as he did so. The back end locked solid and broke away, spinning him of the side of the road and miraculously into some bushes, which brought the car to a halt. As he was collecting his senses, Buzz saw the two MSVs, unable to stop in time, ram each other head on at over 40 mph.

It was a long time before Buzz had the MG rebuilt to its original pristine condition of before the chase. It was an even longer time before he went back into the valley for a drive. Now it was only in the very early hours of the day when most people were still sleeping of the effects of the good life. And when he saw in the papers that the government would soon be requiring cars to be capable of withstanding 75-mph headon collisions, he stopped driving the MG altogether.

### My Thoughts

*A Nice Morning Drive* is not epic fiction, by any means. The author was a graduate student and his own comments (linked below) indicate he was shocked that it was accepted for publication. Regardless, it's fun and does represent the world-view that Neil Peart had at the time. A lot of Neil's lyrics refer to the negative aspects of world government. He also cites Ayn Rand as an inspiration for some of his work on the sprawling [2112](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2112_(album)) album. I'm not a fan of the writing or world-view of Ms. Rand as she turned out to be a hypocrite in her later years. Regardless, it's great to know the origin of the song and its' tie to the MGB.

### Postscript

Richard S. Foster, the author of the short story found out later about his links to the song and struck up a friendship with Neil Peart. I enjoyed reading the comments from the author on [this page](https://www.bmwbmw.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=22&t=8693&hilit=red+barchetta) about the origin of the song and his motorcycle trips later on.  

**NOTE:** The original content of this quote is on a motorcycle forum site that has an expired SSL certificate. The writer, Rick F, presumably is Richard Foster. That link, for as long as it lives, is a fun read as well. If the site should go offline, I have [his post archived](/assets/documents/rick-foster-forum-post.pdf) on this site. I've confirmed that the document opens, but some browsers seem to have problems with the size of the document.

Thanks, Rick! Hope you have many miles ahead of you.

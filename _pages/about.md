## Pearline's Story

### The Early Story

Pearline was born in England (more details forthcoming), some time in 1971 or 1972. After crossing the
Atlantic, she was sold to someone that lived in a small town northeast of Dallas, Texas. I know this, 
this plate fell out from behind the glove box as I was disassembling the interior in 2020, prior to 
having body work done.

From my understanding, this plate was used by the dealership service department to mark the logs 
when a vehicle was serviced. It probably was put into an embossing machine, like an old-time credit
card imprinter, so that multiple copies were made--one for the customer, one for the service department,
and one for the billing department.

### Joins the Family

At some point, in the late 1970's, my sister's father-in-law, Ben, purchased the car. My 
brother-in-law remembers that he was still in college when his dad pulled up in this car. 
Most likely, it was 1978 or 1979. Ben was a physics professor at a small university in western
Oklahoma. I got my undergraduate degree at that same university and I saw him driving this car
several times a week. Ben was probably 6'3" (190 cm) and weighed at least 300 pounds (135 kg). It was
quite a sight seeing him get out of that tiny car.

When Ben retired from teaching in the 1990's, he no longer drove the MGB. His daughter drove it 
for a few years when she was in college and then parked it for good. It had sat in the garage for 
several years without being started, and it was covered in boxes. They decided they were going to
sell the car, so I jumped at the chance to purchase it.

### My Story Begins

At the time, I was living in Austin, TX. I put in a new battery and new tires put on. I had a brake 
cylinder replaced that continued to leak brake fluid for the next 20 years and had a shade-tree mechanic 
adjust the carbs. But, it was driveable. I used it as my "more or less" daily commute vehicle, taking 
the windy roads around Lake Travis to an office building a bit north of downtown Austin.

In 2001, we moved to my hometown in Oklahoma to raise our kids and be closer to family. I still
drove the MGB, but it wasn't practical with 2 kids. The MGB became our 3rd car. I'd take it out on 
occasion, but I probably didn't put 2,000 miles total on the odometer after we left Austin. I loaned 
it to my sister, whose father-in-law owned it previously, for one summer and then she returned it. 
After that, it spent a few lonely years in my back garage, gathering dust.

In 2016, my wife lost her battle with cancer after 12 years. As part of my "cleaning", I decided 
to gift the MGB to my niece, who had given our daughter a loving home while my wife and I were at 
cancer treatments. It felt great to see her and her own daughter driving the car around town. After 
a few years, her interest in the car faded and she returned it to me.

### My Story, Redux

It was during this time, the car became a "she" and her name became Pearline.

In 2020, my daughter was a junior in high school when COVID stopped the world. She was understandably 
disappointed that her prom was cancelled. She'd already purchased a dress and wanted to do "something". 
So, we took the MGB out to a wheat field and took pictures of her and a friend in their prom dresses. 
It wasn't much, but it's a memory.

On the way home from the wheat field, the MGB stalled out going down a hill 2 miles from home.
The spot where it died is on Route 66 and a lot of traffic goes by. The carbs were flooded and there
was nothing to do but lift the hood and wait a while. While we waited, friends drove past and some
stopped to offer help (or to provide a smart remark). At that point, I decided to do some restoration
work on her.

### The Restoration

Much of this story has been described in various blog posts. If you want to read them individually
in chronological order, they are tagged with ["restoration"](/tags#restoration). I am
not a purist, but I wanted to keep the car "as original as possible". I used plenty of after-market
parts in this project, but I deliberately didn't want to make a "restomod", with features that would've
looked out of place in the 1970's.

After doing yard work, I washed Pearline and then drove around my hometown to take some beauty shots at local historic sites.

<!--more-->

First stop was the City Park, which houses the swimming pool, rodeo arena, and the fairgrounds. 
Our town has the oldest fair in the state, with rides, games, food, a rodeo, and livestock judging. 
It's kind of a big thing for a small town and all the effort is done by locals--no carnival company
or outside vendors. Sadly, COVID put an end to more than 100 years of tradition last year, but this
year we'll have it running again.

### Rock Island Depot

On the fairgrounds sits the Rock Island depot building that once sat alongside SH-58 and the Rock
Island line at the edge of town. I remember playing on this building when the railroad still ran
daily. These days, it houses the Historical Society.

### Truss Bridge

Next, was the bridge that spans the small creek that runs through the fairgroundss, separating the
rodeo arena from the midway and livestock areas. Previously, an old wooden bridge spanned the
creek and it was always dangerous. The community built this bridge in the mid-2000's as a community 
pride activity, selling engraved bricks as a way to get the townspeople involved. The county moved 
an old iron truss bridge that wasn't being used any longer to the fairgrounds and the people of our
town did the rest.

### Lucille's Station

Finally, out to Lucille's Route 66 station, also known as [Provine Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provine_Service_Station). I have many childhood memories of this place, sometimes stopping for
a cold soda with my Dad after a day of work (he would get a 6-pack of Coors Banquet Beer). I would 
buy beer from Lucille, when turned 18, as the law allowed 18-year olds to buy beer in those days. 
Lucille's beer cooler was infamous for producing beer with just a slight amount of ice in the top of
the bottle when you opened it. If it was a hot day, she'd fish around in the coolers and find a good
one for you.

If you find yourself on Route 66 in western Oklahoma, you'll likely run across Lucille's Station.
Most every guidebook will take you there. Lucille passed away about 20 years ago and her 
[grave marker](https://goo.gl/maps/qTPMtPUfEV6mKxPW8) is in Hydro Masonic Cemetery, about 3 miles 
north of the intersection of SH-58 and Route 66. Her grave marker is obvious to anyone that sees it.

Back home to put Pearline back in her barn before thunderstorms moved in. It's great to have her
back and working well. I still have some smaller mechanical jobs to do on her, but I'm going to
enjoy driving her this summer.

I have more photos of Pearline and the restoration project at my [SmugMug gallery](https://photos.ericcloninger.com/My-1972-MGB).

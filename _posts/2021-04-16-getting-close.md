Stopped at the body shop this morning to see how Pearline is faring. Bonnie (the office manager) saw me pull up and she met me at the door. "Do you want to see your car?" she asked, with a big grin on her face...

Bonnie and one of the body techs led me into the warehouse. The hood and trunk have been attached. The windscreen is back on. Most of the lights are reconnected. They were planning to work on the car more today. The only things that remained were the body moulding, some door hardware, and some of the clips for the convertible top. Hopefully by early next week, I'll have her back.

Pearline has her hood up today, but I patted her fender and said thanks for being with us. The mechanic that has worked 
on her the most had hand surgery last month and won't be able to finish tuning her until some time in December. So, she 
sits in the garage, hopefully content that she's not out on an icy road or dealing with people that drive on the wrong 
side of the road.
